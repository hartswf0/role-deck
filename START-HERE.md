## 🎮 How to Use

### **Three Panels**

- **Center (KEEPER)**: Authority figure with institutional pressures
- **Right (OBSERVER)**: Analysis, personality radars, conflict summary

### **On Mobile**

Use the **⇆** button to switch between panels

### **Negotiation Flow**

Each turn has 3 phases:

1. **PLAN**: AI generates response options
2. **THINK**: AI selects best approach  
3. **SPEAK**: Message delivered to chat

**Personality radars update** after each message!

- **Experiment with themes**: Different colors change the mood
- **Watch the radars**: See how personalities shift during negotiation
- **Replay scenarios**: Try different strategies, see different outcomes
- **Read the Observer**: Check conflict analysis in right panel

1. Display on projector (use Deck Mode)
2. Students vote on dialogue options
3. Observe AI responses
4. Group discussion after each turn
