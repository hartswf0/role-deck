# 🌱 TILTH - The Tetrad Gamepad

**Quick Start Guide**

---

## What is TILTH?

**TILTH** transforms the 8 Feed Loop scenarios (ethical workplace negotiations) into interactive design challenges using the **Tetrad framework**.

Each scenario represents a **hypothetical product** that emerged from workplace ethical conflicts.

**Two ways to play:**
1. **Product Problems** — Redesign the problematic products themselves
2. **Designer Dilemmas** — Play AS the designer, solve the organizational/systemic problems

**16 total scenarios** across both modes.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Step 1: Open TILTH
Open `tetrad-pad.html` in your browser.

### Step 2: Click the Sprout 🌱
Click the **🌱** button in the top-right corner to open the scenario selector.

### Step 3: Choose Your Mode
Toggle between:
- **Product Problems** — Redesign the problematic products
- **Designer Dilemmas** — YOU are the designer facing the ethical crisis

### Step 4: Pick a Scenario
Choose from 8 scenarios in your selected mode:

| # | Product | Emoji | Ethical Tension |
|---|---------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | **GrowthPath** | 📚 | Addictive engagement vs. learner autonomy |
| 2 | **YieldMatch** | 🌾 | Racial bias in AI vs. launch pressure |
| 3 | **TalentFarm** | 📄 | Security vulnerability vs. hierarchy |
| 4 | **ConsentGarden** | 🔒 | Deceptive UX vs. conversion goals |
| 5 | **UnionSprout** | ✊ | Worker organizing vs. visa threats |
| 6 | **AutoGrow AI** | 🌱 | Cultural bias in AI vs. efficiency |
| 7 | **MigrantHarvest** | 👁️ | Surveillance vs. worker dignity |
| 8 | **FeedLoop** | 🔄 | Mission integrity vs. survival |

### Step 4: Explore with Tetrad Directions

After loading a scenario:
- **Prompt auto-fills** with the product description
- **D-pad directions auto-set** with suggested starting points
- Press **A** (or Enter) to generate 4 design options

**The Tetrad Framework:**
- **↑ Enhance** — Amplify a core affordance
- **→ Obsolesce** — Remove/displace harmful features
- **← Retrieve** — Revive forgotten practices
- **↓ Reverse** — Show what happens at overextension

### Step 5: Pick an Option
Click one of the 4 options to:
- Seed the next iteration
- Continue exploring that direction

### Step 6: Build an Artifact
Toggle **Build Mode** (🛠) then press **A** to generate a complete HTML prototype addressing the ethical tension.

## 🎭 Understanding the Two Modes

### Product Problems Mode
**What you design:** The product itself  
**Your role:** External designer with authority  
**Focus:** Ethical alternatives to harmful artifacts  
**Example output:** Redesigned learning platform without addictive mechanics  
**Tetrad applied to:** Product features and affordances  

### Designer Dilemmas Mode  
**What you design:** Organizational infrastructure  
**Your role:** The actual designer from the scenario (limited power)  
**Focus:** Systemic solutions to second-order problems  
**Example output:** Metrics system that makes learning valuable vs. engagement  
**Tetrad applied to:** Governance, processes, and organizational systems  

### When to Use Each Mode

| Use Product Problems when... | Use Designer Dilemmas when... |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| You want to explore ethical product design | You want to explore organizational change |
| Focus is on user experience | Focus is on institutional dynamics |
| Question: "What should this be?" | Question: "How do we change the system?" |
| Output: Working prototype | Output: Governance/metrics/process system |
| Stakeholders: End users | Stakeholders: Internal + power structures |
| Design challenge: Technical/UX | Design challenge: Political/systemic |

### The Same Scenario, Different Lenses

**GrowthPath Example:**

**Product Problems:**
- Design a non-addictive learning platform
- Remove dark patterns, add autonomy features
- Output: Educational app prototype
- Success: Users learn without addiction

**Designer Dilemmas:**
- YOU are Maya Chen, L&D Lead
- VP Growth demands engagement metrics
- Design measurement system valuing learning outcomes
- Output: Dashboard + methodology for leadership
- Success: Organization shifts from engagement to learning value

**Both are valid design challenges!** One focuses on the artifact, the other on the conditions that created it.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Each TILTH scenario is structured to:

1. **Describe the current system** — What exists now
2. **Surface the ethical tension** — The core conflict
3. **Name the power dynamic** — Who's pressuring whom
4. **Set the design challenge** — What needs redesigning

The Tetrad framework helps you explore **four facets** of each problem:
- What to **amplify** (Enhance)
- What to **remove** (Obsolesce)
- What to **restore** (Retrieve)
- What **reverses** at overextension (Reverse)

## 💡 Tips for Success

**Start Simple**
- Try GrowthPath (#1) first — clearest ethical tension
- Use suggested directions initially
- Get comfortable with option picking

**Experiment with Directions**
- Same prompt + different directions = different insights
- Try all 4 directions for comprehensive exploration
- Lock direction when you find an interesting thread

**Build Early, Build Often**
- Don't wait for "perfect" — build rough prototypes
- Iterate based on what you see
- Use history to compare approaches

**Use the Context**
- Remember the stakeholders in each scenario
- Consider power dynamics (visa threats, hierarchy, etc.)
- Ask: "What would actually work in this situation?"

**Combine Products**
- GrowthPath + ConsentGarden = Educational consent UX
- MigrantHarvest + UnionSprout = Worker-controlled tracking
- YieldMatch + AutoGrow AI = Bias-aware agricultural AI

## 🎓 Educational Use

### For Workshops
1. Display TILTH on projector
2. Class votes on scenario
3. Discuss directions as group
4. Students vote on options
5. Generate artifact together
6. Critique and iterate

### For Assignments
- **Individual**: Pick 2 scenarios, build artifacts, write reflection
- **Group**: Each person takes 1 direction, synthesize final design
- **Portfolio**: Document design process, show iteration history

### For Research
- **Comparative**: How do different directions address the same tension?
- **Stakeholder**: Redesign from each character's perspective
- **Systems**: What structural changes would prevent these dilemmas?
