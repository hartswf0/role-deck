# 🎭 Designer Dilemmas — Playing as the Designer

**The Second-Order Problem Mode**

---

## What's Different?

In **Designer Dilemmas** mode, you don't redesign the problematic product — **you ARE the designer** who discovered the problem and must design *organizational infrastructure* to fix the systemic issue.

### Product Problems vs Designer Dilemmas

| Aspect | Product Problems | Designer Dilemmas |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Your role** | External designer | The actual designer from the scenario |
| **What you design** | The product itself | Organizational systems/infrastructure |
| **Focus** | Artifact that causes harm | Second-order governance/metrics/process |
| **Example** | Redesign addictive learning platform | Create metrics system that values learning over engagement |
| **Stakeholders** | Users of the product | You + leadership + affected parties |
| **Power dynamic** | Designer with authority | Designer facing institutional resistance |

## How Designer Mode Changes the Game

### The Ethical Trap Structure

Each designer dilemma has:
1. **Evidence of harm** — You discovered/built something problematic
2. **Institutional pressure** — Leadership wants the harmful version
3. **Power imbalance** — You lack formal authority to block it
4. **Personal risk** — Job, visa, career consequences for resistance
5. **Moral imperative** — You know it's wrong and have the skills to fix it

### What You're Actually Designing

Not the product — the **infrastructure** to prevent/fix the problem:

- **Metrics systems** that change what's measured and valued
- **Process architectures** that route around broken hierarchies
- **Governance structures** that legally enforce values
- **Transparency mechanisms** that make harm visible and costly
- **Alternative incentives** that align ethics with business success
- **Protection systems** for vulnerable stakeholders
- **Evidence frameworks** that document patterns for accountability

### The Tetrad Applied to Systems

Using the four directions on organizational infrastructure:

**↑ Enhance** — Amplify what's working  
- Make good practices more visible/rewarding
- Scale ethical approaches across organization
- Strengthen existing accountability mechanisms

**→ Obsolesce** — Remove what's broken  
- Displace harmful metrics/incentives
- Make unethical approaches non-viable
- Sunset toxic processes

**← Retrieve** — Restore what was lost  
- Revive pre-corruption practices
- Return to founding mission/values
- Reconnect to stakeholder trust

**↓ Reverse** — Show what happens at extremes  
- Expose inversion risk of current path
- Demonstrate system collapse scenarios
- Make consequences visceral for decision-makers

## Example Session: The Growth Dilemma

**1. Click 🌱 → Switch to "Designer Dilemmas" → Pick "The Growth Dilemma"**

Loads:
```
You are Maya Chen, Learning & Development Lead.

Your platform uses engagement metrics that drive 47% growth 
but create addictive patterns. VP Growth says "data speaks 
for itself."

Design a new measurement and evaluation system that captures 
genuine learning outcomes...
```

**2. D-pad auto-sets:** ← Retrieve + → Obsolesce

**3. Press A → Get 4 organizational infrastructure options:**
- **Enhance**: Create "learning depth score" metric alongside engagement
- **Obsolesce**: Phase out streak mechanics in favor of mastery milestones
- **Retrieve**: Restore pre-gamification assessment methods
- **Reverse**: Show leadership what happens when addicted users burn out and quit

**4. Pick "Enhance" → Design dual-metric dashboard**

Iterates on:
- How to present learning depth to leadership
- What data sources prove learning (not just clicks)
- How to transition without immediate revenue loss

**5. Lock "Enhance" + Auto-step 3 times**

Explores:
- Metric calculation methodology
- Dashboard UI for executives
- Pilot program structure
- Change management strategy

**6. Toggle Build Mode → Generate prototype**

Outputs: Complete HTML dashboard showing:
- Learning depth metrics
- Engagement metrics (for comparison)
- Long-term value predictions
- Transition roadmap visualization

**Result:** Organizational infrastructure that shifts culture from addiction to learning

## Key Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Evidence Infrastructure
**Problem:** Leadership ignores/dismisses harm claims  
**Solution:** Design systems that make harm measurable and undeniable  
**Examples:**
- Bias impact dashboards
- User harm documentation
- Cost-of-deception calculators
- Long-term value tracking

### Pattern 2: Bypass Architectures
**Problem:** Formal channels blocked by hierarchy/power  
**Solution:** Design alternate routes that preserve truth flow  
**Examples:**
- Anonymous escalation systems
- Cross-level review processes
- External accountability connections
- Whistleblower protections

### Pattern 3: Alternative Incentives
**Problem:** Current incentives reward harmful behavior  
**Solution:** Design metric systems that make ethics profitable  
**Examples:**
- Trust/retention as business metrics
- Cultural competence as feature
- Worker dignity as competitive advantage
- Mission alignment as legal requirement

### Pattern 4: Irreversible Commitments
**Problem:** Leadership might revert to harmful practices  
**Solution:** Design governance structures that legally bind values  
**Examples:**
- B-Corp/PBC certifications
- Stakeholder board seats
- Mission-based bylaws
- Transparency commitments

### Pattern 5: Resilient Infrastructure
**Problem:** Company might try to shut down ethical systems  
**Solution:** Design with shutdown resistance and external backup  
**Examples:**
- Decentralized organizing tools
- External evidence repositories
- Multi-stakeholder governance
- Legal fail-safes

## Comparing Your Designs Across Modes

### Same Scenario, Different Lens

**GrowthPath example:**

| Mode | Product Problems | Designer Dilemmas |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **You design** | New learning platform | Metrics & evaluation system |
| **Artifact** | Educational app with ethical engagement | Organizational dashboard for learning outcomes |
| **Users** | Students/learners | Leadership + L&D team |
| **Success** | Non-addictive learning experience | Culture shift from engagement to learning value |
| **Power** | Designer with product authority | Designer fighting institutional metrics |

**Both are valid!** Designer Dilemmas adds the meta-layer: *How do we build organizations that prevent these problems in the first place?*

## Tips for Designer Mode

**1. Embrace the Power Imbalance**
- You're not the CEO — design around that
- Your solutions must work with limited authority
- Focus on what you CAN control (evidence, transparency, architecture)

**2. Design for Adoption**
- Leadership won't accept "just do the right thing"
- Show business value of ethical approaches
- Create transition paths, not ultimatums
- Make compliance easier than resistance

**3. Protect Yourself**
- Include legal safeguards in your designs
- Document everything (audit trails, evidence)
- Design anonymity/protection for vulnerable actors
- Consider what happens if you're fired/deported

**4. Think Systemically**
- One-off fixes won't work — design infrastructure
- Create feedback loops that surface problems early
- Build in accountability mechanisms
- Make harm visible and costly

**5. Use All Four Directions**
- **Enhance**: What good practices can you amplify?
- **Obsolesce**: What toxic incentives must go?
- **Retrieve**: What values can you restore?
- **Reverse**: What warnings can you make visceral?

## Synthesis: Product + Designer Modes

**Ultimate workflow:**

1. **Product Mode**: Design the ethical alternative product
2. **Designer Mode**: Design the organizational infrastructure to build/maintain it
3. **Reflection**: What systemic changes make the ethical product inevitable?

**Example:**
- Product Mode: Redesign GrowthPath without addiction mechanics
- Designer Mode: Design metrics that make non-addictive platforms profitable
- Synthesis: Organization that can't build addictive products even if it wanted to
