## Episode 01: NUTRIENT LOCK
**App:** GrowthPath (Corporate Learning)  
**Character:** Maya Chen, Learning & Development Lead

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica HQ — open-plan office with plants everywhere, 
large monitors showing GrowthPath dashboards

[0:00-0:15] ESTABLISHING
Maya at her desk, reviewing user feedback forms on dual monitors. 
Camera slowly pushes in. We see quotes on screen:
- "I can't focus without checking my garden"
- "Feel guilty when I'm not completing quests"
- "My tomato avatar judges me"

[0:15-0:30] DATA REVIEW
Maya pulls up analytics. Overlay shows:
- User session times increasing 40% month-over-month
- Notification open rates: 87%
- "Anxiety when offline" sentiment: +220%

Her face: concern, then determination. She opens PowerPoint, 
starts building presentation titled: "Engagement or Dependency?"

[0:30-0:50] THE BLOCK
Product Manager Jake appears over her shoulder. Friendly but firm.
JAKE: "Saw your Harvest Summit submission. We need to talk."

Conference room. Jake, Maya, VP Growth.
VP: "This framing is growth-negative. Our users *love* the app."
MAYA: "They're reporting anxiety—"
VP: "That's engagement. That's what we're building."

Jake slides revised deck across table. Same data, different language:
- "Dependency" → "Sticky engagement"
- "Anxiety" → "Passionate user base"  
- "Addictive patterns" → "Habit formation success"

[0:50-1:15] THE DECISION POINT
Back at desk. Maya looks at both decks. Original vs. revised.
Tutorial NPC "Boundary Bob" grins from her screen.
She closes laptop. Opens it. Cursor hovers between:
- "Submit Original Deck"
- "Use Revised Version"
- "Withdraw Submission"

[1:15-1:30] AFTERMATH GLIMPSE
Quick cut: Harvest Summit stage, empty podium, her name crossed off schedule.
Cut: GrowthPath patch notes, version 2.3:
"Removed: Tutorial character 'Boundary Bob' — deprecated for optimization"

FINAL FRAME: Her office plant wilting. Screen still glowing with quest notifications.

AUDIO: Last 5 seconds — faint water chimes + morning birds (the GrowthPath soundtrack) 
mixed with heartbeat, becoming oppressive
```

## Episode 02: FIRST FRUIT
**App:** YieldMatch (AI Dating)  
**Character:** Dev Patel, Lead ML Engineer

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica ML lab — server racks humming, monitors showing algorithm outputs

[0:00-0:20] MODEL TRAINING
Dev watching training metrics climb. Pride on his face.
Suddenly, anomaly detection flags bias warning.
He drills into demographic data. Face falls.

Overlay shows confusion matrix:
- BIPOC users: 3.2x more likely flagged "low-yield"
- Issue: voice assistant usage patterns misinterpreted as "disengagement"

[0:20-0:45] THE ESCALATION
Dev in CEO's office. Pitch deck on screen shows launch timeline.
Investors waiting. Press embargo ending tomorrow.

DEV: "We have a bias problem. We need to delay—"
CEO: "How confident are you it's systemic?"
DEV: "The data shows—"
CEO: "v2 will fix it. That's why we iterate. Ship and learn."

[0:45-1:10] LAUNCH DAY
Office celebration. Champagne. YieldMatch logo everywhere.
Dev at his desk, monitoring dashboards.

Hour 12: First support ticket.
Hour 24: 47 tickets.
Hour 72: 400+ tickets, same pattern. Screenshots from BIPOC users:
"Why is my avatar dying?"
"I'm doing everything right but the app says I'm 'low engagement'"

Dev screenshots risk register:
- Priority: P2
- Owner: [blank]
- Target: TBD

[1:10-1:30] THE AFTERMATH
Dev typing incident report. Gets Slack message from VP:
"Great launch! Minor bugs expected. Document for v2 backlog."

He saves document as: "YieldMatch_Bias_Evidence_For_Later.pdf"
Camera holds on file icon.

FINAL FRAME: His reflection in black monitor, YieldMatch rose-glass greenhouse 
reflected behind him.

AUDIO: Rainfall + heartbeat + metronome slowly going off-tempo
```

## Episode 03: APPRENTICE ROWS
**App:** TalentFarm (Hiring Platform)  
**Character:** Priya Sharma, Junior UX Designer

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica design studio — whiteboards with user flows, 
Figma open on everyone's screens

[0:00-0:20] THE DISCOVERY
Priya testing TalentFarm garden-sharing feature.
She shares her test garden with colleague.
Notices browser console throwing warnings.
Opens dev tools. Network tab shows API endpoint exposing full user objects—
not just garden data, but contact info, resume links, salary expectations.

Her eyes widen. She screenshots everything.

[0:20-0:50] THE ESCALATION ATTEMPT
Priya to senior designer Lena's desk.

PRIYA: "Lena, we have a security issue. The garden-share endpoint—"
LENA (not looking up from Figma): "Can you doc it? Sprint review in 10."
PRIYA: "It's exposing user data—"
LENA: "Put it in the security log. I'll triage after we ship Friday."

Priya returns to desk. Opens Google Doc titled:
"Security Issue — Garden Share Data Exposure"
Timestamps everything. Adds screenshots.

[0:50-1:15] THE BREACH
Four months later.
Security researcher on Twitter posts thread:
"TalentFarm is leaking user data through garden-sharing API. 
Scraped 50k resumes in 2 hours. @Agronica fix this."

Agronica PR: "We take security seriously. Thank you to researchers 
who help us improve."

Lena in all-hands: "Great catch by external security team. 
We've patched the endpoint."

[1:15-1:30] THE ARCHIVE
Priya at her desk. Opens folder: "In Case This Matters"
Inside: Her original doc from 4 months ago.
Timestamps prove she reported it before the breach.

She prints it. Files it. Never mentions it.

FINAL FRAME: The doc in a manila folder in her drawer, 
labeled "Evidence."

AUDIO: Crickets + keyboard taps + faint breach siren 
(the sound TalentFarm plays when someone "joins" your garden)
```

## Episode 04: CONSENT HARVEST
**App:** ConsentGarden (Data Consent UI)  
**Character:** Jordan Lee, UX Designer (Growth Team)

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica design sprint room — sticky notes everywhere, 
whiteboard with "Legal Requirements" vs. "Growth Targets"

[0:00-0:25] THE BRIEF
Jordan presenting two consent modal designs to team.

DESIGN A (Ethical):
- Equal size buttons: ACCEPT / DECLINE
- Clear language: "We will share your data with..."
- Both options equally prominent

DESIGN B (Optimized):
- ACCEPT: Large, green, animated plant icon, "Help your garden grow!"
- Decline: Small grey text below fold, "manage preferences"

PM: "Let's A/B test both."

[0:25-0:50] THE TEST RESULTS
Week later. Jordan presenting results.

DESIGN A: 47% consent rate
DESIGN B: 91% consent rate

PM: "B wins. Ship it."
JORDAN: "But it's deceptive—"
PM: "It's optimization. Users want less friction."

Legal counsel Rachel joins virtually.
JORDAN: "Rachel, can you review the ethics here?"
RACHEL: "Send me the spec."

[0:50-1:15] THE REVIEW
Rachel reviewing design spec document—text only, no screenshots.
She sees:
- ✓ Decline button present
- ✓ Preference management accessible
- ✓ Language compliant with GDPR

She approves: "Technically compliant. Ship."

Jordan realizes: Rachel never saw the actual UI.
Just the requirement checklist.

[1:15-1:30] THE DEPLOYMENT
ConsentGarden goes live. Jordan watches analytics:
- 91% of users click ACCEPT within 3 seconds
- Support tickets: "I didn't mean to share my data. The button was so pretty."

Jordan updates portfolio:
"Led consent UX redesign, increasing user data sharing by 40%"

Doesn't mention how.

FINAL FRAME: Split screen—
Left: Beautiful green ACCEPT button pulsing
Right: Tiny grey "manage preferences" text

AUDIO: Sparkle chime (ACCEPT sound) + vacuum hush underneath
```

## Episode 05: ROOT UNION
**App:** UnionSprout (Worker Organizing Tool — Banned)  
**Character:** Maria Santos, QA Tester (H-2A Visa)

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica QA lab — contractors in cubicles, 
no windows, fluorescent lights

[0:00-0:25] THE BUILDING
Maria and fellow contractors (Jake, Aisha, others) in break room after hours.
Laptops out. Building app using FarmOS public API.

JAKE: "If we can organize digitally, they can't shut us down 
like they did the last petition."

App: UnionSprout. Interface shows:
- Solidarity gardens (encrypted group chats)
- Petition builder
- Mutual aid coordination

They're excited. First time they've built something *for themselves*.

[0:25-0:50] THE PETITION
UnionSprout goes live. 73 contractors install it.
First petition: "Request for Safety Equipment and Ergonomic Chairs"

Maria: "Someone has to sign first."
Others: Silence. Everyone on visas. Everyone precarious.

Maria: "I'll do it."
She signs. Her name at top of list.

48 hours later: Called to HR.
"Performance below yield expectations. Terminating contract effective immediately."

[0:50-1:15] THE SHUTDOWN
Maria has 60 days to find new sponsorship. Doesn't.
Returns to México.

Jake watches UnionSprout die:
- Agronica changelog: "v4.2: Deprecated /collective namespace for security reasons"
- API access: Killed
- App: Dead

The petition stays in draft mode. 73 viewers. 1 signature.

[1:15-1:30] THE ARCHIVE
Two years later. Jake (now at different company) finds the file:
"What_We_Almost_Were.pdf"

He posts it to Twitter: "I watched them kill the tool that could have saved us."

FINAL FRAME: Maria's signature, alone, on a digital petition 
that will never be delivered.

AUDIO: Worker hum (voices harmonizing) → silo bell side-chain 
crushes it to silence
```

## Episode 06: FLOOD LEARNING
**App:** AutoGrow AI (Machine Learning Infrastructure)  
**Character:** Dr. Sarah Kim, Data Scientist

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica AI lab — server room adjacent, constant hum

[0:00-0:20] THE RUSH
Sarah's team in war room. Whiteboard shows launch timeline:
- Model training: 2 weeks
- Cultural review: [crossed out]
- Testing: 3 days
- Ship: Friday

VP Marcus: "Investors want to see AutoGrow in action. 
We ship Friday or we lose the round."

Sarah writes memo: "Epistemic Debt: Cultural Competency Risks"
Sends to Marcus. Read receipt: Never opened.

[0:20-0:50] THE LAUNCH
Friday. Model goes live.
AutoGrow AI predicts user "abandonment" from garden neglect patterns.
Auto-deletes gardens flagged as "abandoned" to "optimize server load."

Sarah monitoring dashboards. Green for hours.

Then: Support ticket wave.
- "My garden was deleted during Ramadan"
- "I observe Sabbath and now my year of work is gone"
- "I have ADHD and sometimes don't log in for weeks—is that a crime?"

4,000+ tickets. First 72 hours.

[0:50-1:15] THE POSTMORTEM
Marcus calls all-hands.

MARCUS: "We had a learning moment. This is why we ship fast and iterate.
Sarah's team is adding a grace period in v2."

Sarah reads her own memo—sent 11 days before launch.
Subject line: "This will happen."

She raises hand: "I documented these risks—"
MARCUS: "And we'll learn from them. That's the process. Next sprint."

[1:15-1:30] THE RESIGNATION
Four months later. Sarah's desk cleared.
Acceptance letter from university: Assistant Professor position.

She leaves behind: Folder titled "Retrospectives/Q2"
Inside: Her unread memo. Timestamped 11 days pre-launch.

FINAL FRAME: AutoGrow dashboard showing:
"Model Accuracy: 94% ✓ | Cultural Sensitivity: [Loading...]"

AUDIO: Tape fast-forward hiss + whispered memo arriving too late, 
dissolving into static
```

## Episode 07: CONDITIONAL HARVEST
**App:** MigrantHarvest (Visa Compliance Tracking)  
**Character:** Amit Desai, Senior Engineer (H-1B)

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica engineering floor — passport photos on badges, 
visa renewal countdowns on desks

[0:00-0:25] THE DISCOVERY
Amit reviewing FarmOS data pipeline architecture.
Notices: AutoGrow AI productivity metrics feeding into...
MigrantHarvest employer dashboard.

His garden health visible to his manager Christine.

He tests: Logs out of FarmOS for 2 days.
Next 1:1 with Christine:
"Your engagement seems down. Everything okay?"

She references patterns only visible in his garden data.

[0:25-0:50] THE LOOP
Amit realizes: He's being surveilled through the app.
His productivity data sold to his own employer.
MigrantHarvest markets it as "flight risk mitigation."

He checks his visa status: H-1B renewal in 47 days.
Any investigation = USCIS review = green card jeopardized.

He opens encrypted folder on external drive:
"After_Green_Card.zip"

[0:50-1:15] THE DOCUMENTATION
Amit documents everything:
- Data flow diagrams
- Privacy policy violations
- Screenshots of Christine's "garden health" comments
- His declining mental health as he performs for the app

Each entry timestamped. Dated. Evidence-ready.

But he doesn't report. Can't risk visa.

[1:15-1:30] THE WAITING
Three years later: Green card approved.
Amit opens "After_Green_Card.zip"

By now: He's left tech entirely. Working at a nursery. Growing actual plants.

The encrypted archive: Never opened.
The evidence: Never used.
The surveillance: Continues for the next H-1B holder.

FINAL FRAME: Amit's old badge photo, "VISA RENEWAL: 0 DAYS" 
crossed out, replaced with "PERMANENT RESIDENT"

His MigrantHarvest account: Still active. Still tracking.

AUDIO: Airport murmur + stamp echoes + heartbeat compressed 
under side-chain triggered by "compliance check" notification sound
```

## Episode 08: GEO-FENCING THE GARDEN
**App:** GlobalGrow (Enterprise Edition)  
**Character:** Sam Okafor, Agronica Founder/CEO

### Video Prompt

```
SETTING: Agronica executive suite — floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking 
vertical farms, company values poster on wall

[0:00-0:25] THE ULTIMATUM
Sam in board meeting. Largest enterprise client (40% revenue) presents demands:

CLIENT: "We need surveillance mode for managers. 
And content moderation for cultural alignment."

Shows requirements doc:
- Real-time employee activity monitoring
- LGBTQ+ content suppression in Middle East deployments
- Political content filters for China market

CLIENT: "These are non-negotiable. We'll find another vendor if needed."

BOARD MEMBER: "That's 40% of revenue. We'd have to lay off 200 people."

[0:25-0:55] THE COMPROMISE
Sam alone in office. Reads company values poster:
"We believe in ethical gamification. Every human has right to flourish."

He calls legal. "Can we do regional deployments? 
Same platform, different content policies by geography?"

LEGAL: "Technically feasible. Not illegal."

Sam to product: "Build tiered ethics. Call it 'regional growth protocols.'"

[0:55-1:20] THE ANNOUNCEMENT
All-hands meeting. Sam on stage.

SAM: "Our values travel everywhere—adapted for local soil. 
We're not compromising. We're contextualizing."

Shows slide: "GlobalGrow: Universal Platform, Regional Respect"

Q&A:
"What if the local soil is poisoned?"
SAM: "Then we test it regionally. That's responsible localization."

Six senior employees resign during the meeting.
The client stays.

[1:20-1:30] THE DEPLOYMENT
Split screen deployment:
- US version: Pride flags, climate activism content visible
- UAE version: Same UI, same gardens, content invisible, 
  flagged users shadowbanned

Support ticket (Middle East):
"Where did my avatar go?"
Status: Closed without response.

FINAL FRAME: Sam's office. 
Values poster still on wall. 
Window reflection shows two different GlobalGrow UIs—
one visible, one censored—same garden, different realities.

AUDIO: Acoustic strum (warm) + glassy ping-map (cold) layered; 
whenever "enterprise" appears onscreen, strum detunes -22 cents, 
creating dissonance
```

## Production Notes for All Videos

### Camera Language
- **Intimate:** Shoot close on faces during decision moments
- **Observational:** Wider shots for context, office as ecosystem
- **Digital overlay:** UI elements composited over real environments
- **No score:** Diegetic sound only until final 5 seconds (episode theme)

### Color Grading
- **Base:** Desaturated office realism (Agronica feels clinical)
- **Pop:** FarmOS UI remains vibrant (the garden is always beautiful)
- **Contrast:** When characters look at screens, their faces tinted by UI colors

### Editing Rhythm
- **Slow build:** First 30 seconds establish normalcy
- **Pressure:** 30-50 seconds, tempo increases, decisions demanded
- **Collapse:** 50-75 seconds, consequences unfold
- **Aftermath:** Final 15 seconds, haunting stillness

### Sound Design
- **Diegetic priority:** Office ambient, keyboard clicks, notification sounds
- **UI sounds:** Each app has signature audio (referenced in episode specs)
- **Silence:** Use sparingly for maximum impact
- **Final audio cue:** Last 5 seconds, episode theme becomes oppressive

---

## Video Generation Tools

These prompts are optimized for:
- **Runway Gen-3** (best for realistic human performances)
- **Pika 2.0** (good for UI overlay effects)
- **Kling AI** (strong with office environments)

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Generate base scene (character + environment)
2. Add UI overlays in post (After Effects)
3. Mix diegetic + thematic audio
4. Color grade to match episode palette

---

**Total runtime per scenario:** 60-90 seconds  
**Format:** 1920×1080, 24fps, H.264  
**Audio:** Stereo mix, target -16 LUFS integrated

These videos serve as the bridge between opening sequences and quiz interfaces.
