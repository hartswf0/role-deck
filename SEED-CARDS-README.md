# TILTH Seed Catalog — Professional Identity Cards

## Botanical Transformation

**Original:** Generic professional identity cards (Bartle taxonomy)  
**New:** Seed packet catalog for "growing" ethical practitioners in FarmOS soil

## Plant Metaphor Mappings

### Identity → Seed Variety
- **Challenger** → Thorn Vine (disrupts, spreads aggressively, hard to contain)
- **Custodian** → Guardian Oak (deep roots, protective canopy, slow-growing)
- **Educator** → Teacher's Moss (spreads knowledge, covers surface, gentle colonizer)
- **Ponderer** → Dormant Bulb (waits for perfect conditions, may never sprout)
- **Harmonizer** → Bridge Lichen (symbiotic, connects ecosystems, requires both sides)
- **Translator** → Code Grass (adapts to any soil, speaks all nutrient languages)
- **Policy-Adherent** → Hedge Plant (follows lines exactly, trimmed to specification)
- **Guild Member** → Single-Crop Grain (knows one thing deeply, won't cross-pollinate)

### Metrics → Growth Conditions
- **Aspiration Score** → Ideal Germination Rate (what it wants to become)
- **Impact Score** → Harvest Yield (actual effect on ecosystem)
- **Risk Score** → Frost Tolerance (survives institutional winter?)
- **Constraint Score** → Soil Requirements (what conditions it needs)

### Radar Chart → Seed Cross-Section
Shows internal growth potential across 5 dimensions:
- Root depth (stability)
- Stem strength (resilience)
- Leaf spread (reach/influence)
- Flower visibility (public stance)
- Seed production (reproducibility)

## Visual Style

### Seed Packet Aesthetic
- **Paper texture:** Brown kraft paper, slightly worn
- **Typography:** Oswald Condensed (like 1940s seed catalogs)
- **Border:** Deckled edges, vintage feel
- **Color palette:** Earth tones + selective neon (GMO markers)
- **Iconography:** Line-art botanical illustrations
- **Stamps:** "TILTH CERTIFIED" "OPEN-POLLINATED" "HEIRLOOM VARIETY"

### Print Optimization
```css
@media print {
  /* 4 cards per page (2x2 grid) */
  /* Remove interactive elements */
  /* High-contrast for B&W printing */
  /* Bleed margins for trimming */
}
```

## Data Source

All data from original `index.html` Bartle taxonomy cards, but:
- Reframed through agrarian lens
- Mapped to Feed Loop universe
- Plant growth metaphors throughout
- Maintains all scoring/metrics

## Features Preserved
✅ Flip cards (front: seed packet / back: cultivation guide)  
✅ Radar charts (styled as seed cross-sections)  
✅ Sortable (by germination rate, yield, frost tolerance)  
✅ Deck mode (single-card inspector)  
✅ Comparison table (growth matrix)  
✅ Print-ready (seed catalog layout)

## New Features
🌱 Seed packet visual design  
🌱 Botanical terminology throughout  
🌱 Growth pattern animations  
🌱 Soil condition indicators  
🌱 Companion planting suggestions (synergies)  
🌱 Pest warnings (vulnerabilities)  

## Usage

1. **As investigation result:** After completing 8 Feed Loop episodes, users receive their "seed packet" showing which identity they enacted
2. **As reference guide:** Browse all 8 varieties to understand ethical archetypes
3. **As printable deck:** Print 4-up on cardstock, cut to size, use for workshops
4. **As botanical field guide:** Study growth patterns of different practitioner types
