## 📐 Design Philosophy: Parts Catalog

### Why 1960s Farm Equipment?
- **Feed Loop universe** = Agricultural technology metaphor
- **Worker-facing** = Parts counter documentation, not marketing
- **No human photos** = Abstract botanical classification
- **Print heritage** = Dot matrix, perforated edges, hatched diagrams
- **Industrial voice** = "TILTH CERTIFIED" not "personality profile"

### Typography Authenticity
- **Folio Bold Condensed** used in actual IH 1966 Cub Cadet ads
- **Eurostile** = 1960s space-age technology signifier
- **Trade Gothic** = American grotesk headline workhorse
- All verified from period farm equipment advertising research

### Visual Elements
- **Perforated edge** = Tractor feed printer paper
- **Dot matrix texture** = 1960s halftone printing
- **Hatched radar fills** = Engineering blueprint style
- **Dashed dividers** = Parts catalog sections
- **Black/yellow/green** = Equipment chassis colors

### Botanical Codes Replace Photos
```
High Risk (>60%):     Medium Risk (30-60%):    Low Risk (<30%):
╔═╗ THORNS ENGAGED     ┌─┐ CANOPY BALANCED      ┌─┐ DORMANT STATE
║█║ Root: Deep         │▓│ Root: Moderate       │░│ Root: Shallow
╚═╝ Spread: Aggressive └─┘ Spread: Controlled   └─┘ Spread: Minimal
```

**Metaphor:** Each practitioner is a cultivar with growth characteristics

## ✨ What Makes The Parts Catalog Special

### 1. **Historically Grounded**
Real 1960s farm equipment advertising typography and layout conventions

### 2. **No Personality Cult**
Abstract botanical codes instead of glamour shots

### 3. **Worker-to-Worker Voice**
Parts counter documentation, not consumer marketing

### 4. **Print Heritage**
Dot matrix texture, perforated edges, engineering schematics

### 5. **Feed Loop Universe Coherent**
Agricultural technology metaphor carried through visual system

### 6. **Accessible Data**
Radar diagrams work in grayscale, ASCII patterns print clearly

### 7. **Archival Quality**
"TILTH CERTIFIED — SERIES 2048" = official documentation

${renderComparison(chosen, character)}
${renderCharacterCard(character)}
```

### To Use Parts Catalog
