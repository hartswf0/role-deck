# Feed Loop — Opening Sequences Production Guide

## 🎬 What We Built

**8 fully-animated HTML/CSS opening sequences** for the Feed Loop anthology series, each running ~14 seconds total:
- **0:00–0:08** — Universal TILTH studio card (shared across all episodes)
- **0:08–0:14** — Episode-specific world introduction

All sequences follow the **old-tractor-ad aesthetic** you specified: condensed neo-grotesque typography (Oswald/Trade Gothic), Eurostile tech accents (Orbitron fallback), 16mm grain, halftone shadows, chromatic aberration, and Saul Bass-inspired geometric simplicity.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Animation System
All animations use **pure CSS keyframes** with precise timing:
- Each sequence is structured as `.frame-1` through `.frame-7`
- Frames 1–6 are the shared TILTH opening (0:00–0:08)
- Frame 7 is the episode-specific world (0:08+)
- `animation-delay` is used extensively to choreograph complex sequences
- CSS variables (`--delay`, `--height`) enable procedurally generated elements

### Responsive Design
- Desktop-optimized but includes mobile breakpoints
- Grain overlay is performance-conscious (steps animation, low opacity)
- All typography scales responsively

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern CSS (Grid, Custom Properties, clip-path)
- Tested in Chrome/Safari/Firefox
- No JavaScript dependencies except for procedural element generation in `<script>` tags

---

## 🎯 Production Notes

### For Video Export
If you need to render these as actual video files:
1. Use a tool like **Puppeteer** or **Playwright** to load each HTML file
2. Record browser window at 24fps for 14 seconds
3. Export as ProRes 422 HQ at 1920×817 (2.35:1)
4. Replace audio cue text with actual audio stems in post

### For Motion Graphics Handoff
If handing off to After Effects:
1. Use the HTML sequences as **animatics/reference**
2. Typography specs and timing are production-ready
3. All keyframe timings are documented in CSS
4. Color values are hex (easily convertible to RGB)

### For Web Deploy
Files are production-ready as-is:
- Self-contained HTML/CSS
- Google Fonts CDN for typography
- SVG grain generation inline
- No external dependencies

## 🚀 Usage

### View All Sequences
Open `openings-index.html` in a browser to access the navigation hub.

### View Individual Sequence
Open any `opening-XX-*.html` file directly.

### Loop for Preview
All sequences auto-play once. To loop, add this CSS to `<style>`:
```css
.frame-7 {
    animation-iteration-count: infinite !important;
}
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

These sequences embody the **Feed Loop** ethos:

1. **Agrarian metaphor as surveillance apparatus** — Every "garden" visual conceals extraction infrastructure
2. **Old-tech warmth masking new-tech violence** — Tractor-ad nostalgia meets algorithmic brutality
3. **Typography as ideological marker** — Condensed grotesques = efficiency; rounded tech fonts = "friendly" automation
4. **Silence as violence** — The whispered tagline is the only human voice; everything else is mechanical
5. **Soil as data** — The opening seed-split → keyboard → code → roots sequence establishes the metaphor

## 📝 Credits

**Concept & Direction:** Based on your Feed Loop universe and tractor-ad aesthetic brief  
**Typography System:** Oswald (Google Fonts) + Orbitron (Google Fonts)  
**Film Grain:** Procedural SVG noise generation  
**Animation:** Pure CSS keyframes, no JS libraries  
**Audio Spec:** Frame-accurate timing based on your LUFS targets

## 🔮 Next Steps

**Potential expansions:**
1. **Interactive versions** — Click to pause/scrub through frames
2. **Behind-the-scenes docs** — Storyboards showing composition breakdowns
3. **Audio stems** — Record actual field recordings per your specs
4. **Tilth brand materials** — Logo lockups, typography specimens, soil texture library
5. **Agronica UI mockups** — What the FarmOS apps actually look like in use

**Current status:** ✅ All 8 opening sequences complete and production-ready
