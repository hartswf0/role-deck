# 🌱 TILTH — The Tetrad Gamepad

**Interactive Ethical Design Exploration Using McLuhan's Tetrad**

---

## What is TILTH?

**TILTH** (The Tetrad Gamepad) is a single-file HTML application that transforms ethical workplace negotiations into interactive design challenges. Using Marshall McLuhan's Tetrad framework, it helps designers explore ethical alternatives to problematic products and organizational systems.

**Origin:** 8 hypothetical products from Feed Loop negotiation scenarios  
**Framework:** McLuhan's Tetrad (Enhance, Obsolesce, Retrieve, Reverse)  
**Modes:** Product Problems + Designer Dilemmas  
**Total scenarios:** 16 (8 per mode)  

---

## 🎮 Two Ways to Play

### 1. Product Problems
**Redesign the problematic products themselves**
- Focus: Ethical alternatives to harmful artifacts
- You are: An external designer with authority
- Output: Working prototypes (HTML artifacts)
- Example: Redesign an addictive learning platform

### 2. Designer Dilemmas
**Play AS the designer facing the ethical crisis**
- Focus: Organizational/systemic solutions
- You are: The character from the scenario (limited power)
- Output: Governance, metrics, process systems
- Example: As the designer, create metrics that value learning over addiction

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open** `tetrad-pad.html` in your browser
2. **Click** the 🌱 button (top-right)
3. **Choose** Product Problems or Designer Dilemmas
4. **Select** a scenario
5. **Press A** to explore 4 design options (one per Tetrad direction)
6. **Pick** an option to iterate

## 📖 The 8 Scenarios

| # | Product | Crisis | Ethical Tension |
|---|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **GrowthPath** 📚 | Addictive learning mechanics | Engagement vs. autonomy |
| 2 | **YieldMatch** 🌾 | Biased crop insurance AI | Fairness vs. launch pressure |
| 3 | **TalentFarm** 📄 | Security vulnerability ignored | Truth vs. hierarchy |
| 4 | **ConsentGarden** 🔒 | Deceptive consent UX | Honesty vs. conversion |
| 5 | **UnionSprout** ✊ | Union organizing blocked | Organizing vs. visa threats |
| 6 | **AutoGrow AI** 🌱 | Cultural bias in AI | Diversity vs. monoculture |
| 7 | **MigrantHarvest** 👁️ | Bathroom break surveillance | Dignity vs. "optimization" |
| 8 | **FeedLoop** 🔄 | Mission-violating funding | Values vs. survival |

Each scenario available in both Product Problems and Designer Dilemmas modes.

## 🎯 The Tetrad Framework

TILTH uses Marshall McLuhan's Tetrad to explore four dimensions of any technology or system:

**↑ ENHANCE** — What does it amplify or intensify?  
**→ OBSOLESCE** — What does it push aside or make obsolete?  
**← RETRIEVE** — What does it bring back from the past?  
**↓ REVERSE** — What does it flip into when pushed to extremes?  

Applied to both:
- **Product design** (features, affordances, interactions)
- **Organizational systems** (metrics, governance, processes)

## 💡 Design Philosophy

### Ethical Design is Not Enough
TILTH recognizes that **ethical products require ethical organizations**. That's why it offers two modes:

1. **Product mode** addresses the artifact
2. **Designer mode** addresses the system

Both are necessary for lasting change.

### The Tetrad as Critical Tool
McLuhan's Tetrad reveals hidden effects:
- What seems enhanced might obsolesce something vital
- What seems obsolete might need retrieving
- What seems beneficial might reverse into harm

TILTH makes these dynamics explorable through design.

### From Critique to Creation
Many ethics tools stop at critique. TILTH goes further:
- Identify the problem (scenario)
- Explore alternatives (options)
- Build solutions (artifacts)
- Design infrastructure (systems)

## 🎨 Example Session

**Scenario:** GrowthPath (addictive learning platform)

**Product Problems Mode (20 min):**
1. Load scenario → describes addictive mechanics
2. Set directions: Reverse + Retrieve
3. Explore 4 options → pick "Obsolesce"
4. Iterate 3x removing manipulative features
5. Build mode → generate non-addictive platform
6. **Output:** Complete HTML learning app

**Designer Dilemmas Mode (30 min):**
1. Switch modes → YOU are Maya Chen, L&D Lead
2. VP Growth demands engagement metrics
3. Set directions: Enhance + Retrieve
4. Explore organizational options
5. Iterate 4x building evidence system
6. Build mode → generate metrics dashboard
7. **Output:** Measurement system for leadership

**Synthesis (10 min):**
- How do the outputs relate?
- What governance would make Product inevitable?
- What prevents organizations from doing this naturally?

**Total time:** 60 minutes  
**Outputs:** 2 HTML artifacts + systemic insights
