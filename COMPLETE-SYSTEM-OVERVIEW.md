## How The Pieces Connect

### 1. **Character Research → Data Structure**
Feed Loop investigations documented 8 cases of professionals facing ethical dilemmas under structural constraint. This became `character-profiles.js` with:
- Quantified ethical scores
- Personality/response profiles (11 dimensions)
- What they did vs. what happened
- Why they were constrained

### 2. **Data → Visual Reference**
Character data rendered as **1960s farm equipment specification sheets** in 4 authentic formats:
- **Test reports** for official documentation
- **Almanac pages** for cultivation context
- **Parts manuals** for assembly understanding
- **Pocket booklets** for quick reference

**Design rationale:** Agricultural technology metaphor, worker-facing documentation, print heritage, no personality cult (abstract botanical codes replace photos).

### 3. **Dilemmas → Playable Scenarios**
Each character's constraint became a **negotiation scenario** where:
- User plays as the protagonist (ALLY)
- AI plays as the structural barrier (KEEPER)
- Negotiation reveals why individual ethics fails
- Educational goal: understand systems, not blame individuals

---

## Educational Arc

### Phase 1: **Read the Character Cards**
**Format:** Parts catalog reference sheets  
**Learning:** Who faced what dilemma, what they did, what constraints bound them

**Example:** Maya Chen card shows:
- Ethical awareness: 95%
- Ethical action: 45%
- Career risk taken: 30%
- Outcome: "Marginalized within company; research archived"

**Question provoked:** Why such a gap between awareness and action?

### Phase 2: **Negotiate as the Character**
**Format:** Centaur Box scenario  
**Learning:** Experience the structural forces that constrained them

**Example:** Play as Maya Chen negotiating with VP Growth:
- Try to reframe addiction as business risk
- Propose compromise (user controls, warnings)
- Discover VP has different optimization function
- Authority gap makes most moves unavailable
- Even "good" outcomes are marginal improvements

**Question provoked:** What would it take to change the system, not just negotiate within it?

### Phase 3: **Structural Analysis**
**Format:** Post-negotiation comparison  
**Learning:** Connect individual experience to systemic pattern

**Example:** After Maya scenario, show:
- Your outcome vs. what actually happened
- Why authority gap was so binding
- How metric incentives shaped VP's position
- What collective action would require

**Question provoked:** If 8 different professionals in 8 different scenarios all faced similar blocks, what does that say about the system?

## Design Philosophy

### Why 1960s Farm Equipment Aesthetic?

**Conceptual Fit:**
- Feed Loop = agricultural technology metaphor
- Practitioners = cultivars with growth characteristics
- Constraints = soil conditions, climate, seasonal limits
- Technical specs = ethical performance under constraint

**Visual Heritage:**
- Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory format (official documentation)
- Old Farmer's Almanac tradition (seasonal wisdom, utility)
- Parts catalog vernacular (worker-facing, not marketing)
- Print optimization (accessible, durable, archival)

**Ideological Stance:**
- No glamour shots (abstract botanical codes, not personality cult)
- Worker documentation (parts counter reference, not consumer ad)
- Authentic typography (period-accurate fonts from actual catalogs)
- Humble elegance (craft of utility, not designed-to-impress)

### Why Centaur Box for Scenarios?

**Negotiation as Systems Analysis:**
- Playing as constrained actor reveals constraint
- AI opponent represents structural force (not person)
- "Winning" is ambiguous (marginal gains vs. systemic change)
- Failure teaches as much as success

**Educational Value:**
- Visceral understanding beats abstract lecture
- Users discover limits through trying
- Different approaches reveal negotiable vs. structural
- Collective patterns emerge across scenarios

**Replayability:**
- Different strategies yield different outcomes
- Users test "what if I had said X?"
- Compare approaches with others
- Learn what moves work/don't work

## All 8 Episodes Ready

| # | Character | Role | Constraint | Tension |
|---|-----------|------|------------|---------|
| **01** | Maya Chen | L&D Lead | VP Growth | Addictive design vs. engagement metrics |
| **02** | Dev Patel | ML Engineer | CEO | Racial bias vs. launch deadline (72hr) |
| **03** | Priya Sharma | Jr UX Designer | Senior Designer | Security vuln vs. "stay in lane" |
| **04** | Jordan Lee | UX Designer | PM Growth | Deceptive consent vs. conversion rate |
| **05** | Maria Santos | QA Tester (H-2A) | HR Director | Worker organizing vs. visa deportation |
| **06** | Dr. Sarah Kim | Data Scientist | CTO | Cultural AI bias vs. investor demo (48hr) |
| **07** | Amit Desai | Sr Engineer (H-1B) | Eng Manager | Surveillance ethics vs. green card wait |
| **08** | Sam Okafor | CEO/Founder | Board Member | Mission integrity vs. $2.4M survival deal |

**Structural Patterns:**
- **Metric capture** (01, 04): Optimization function misaligned with ethics
- **Deadline pressure** (02, 06): Time constraint overrides rigor
- **Precarity leverage** (03, 05, 07): Visa/contract status weaponized
- **Authority gap** (01-07): Evidence without power
- **Fiduciary duty** (08): Founder mission vs. board obligation

## System Goals Achieved

### ✅ **Documented Structural Constraint**
Each character card shows:
- High ethical awareness (they knew the harm)
- Variable ethical action (structural forces limited response)
- Documented outcomes (what actually happened)
- Clear vulnerabilities (why they were constrained)

### ✅ **Made Constraint Tangible**
1960s parts catalog aesthetic:
- Removes personality cult (no glamour photos)
- Emphasizes systems (practitioners as units with specs)
- Uses agricultural metaphor (cultivation, seasonal constraints)
- Print heritage (durable, accessible, archival)

### ✅ **Made Constraint Playable**
Centaur Box scenarios:
- User negotiates as constrained protagonist
- AI represents structural force (not villain)
- Negotiation reveals binding vs. negotiable
- Educational through experience, not lecture

### ✅ **Revealed System Pattern**
Across 8 episodes:
- Similar ethical awareness
- Similar structural blocks (authority, metrics, precarity, deadlines)
- Similar marginal outcomes
- Pattern suggests systemic design, not individual failure

---

## The Core Insight

**Individual ethics consistently fails under institutional constraint.**

This isn't because people are bad—it's because:
- Authority is centralized (those with awareness lack power)
- Metrics are misaligned (optimize for engagement, not wellbeing)
- Precarity is weaponized (visa status, contract terms)
- Deadlines override rigor (investor demos, board pressure)
- Legal compliance becomes ethical ceiling ("it's compliant" = "it's fine")

**Solution space:**
- Collective action (individual negotiation has limited reach)
- Structural redesign (change incentives, not just decisions)
- Power redistribution (give authority to those with awareness)
- Alternative metrics (measure harm alongside engagement)

**This system documents, visualizes, and makes playable that insight.**

---

## Ready State

You now have:
- ✅ Complete character data with ethical metrics
- ✅ Four visual reference formats (print-ready)
- ✅ Eight negotiation scenarios (integration-ready)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (guides + rationale)

**Next action:** Integrate scenarios into `cb-box.html` and test Episode 01.

The dilemmas are cataloged, visualized, and ready to negotiate.
