# Feed Loop — Universe Structure

## Overview

**Feed Loop** is a Black Mirror-style anthology series investigating tech ethics through the metaphor of gamified agriculture. Produced by **Tilth** (a research collective), it exposes **Agronica Corporation** and their platform **FarmOS**—an operating system for human yield optimization disguised as wholesome growth.

---

## The Three Layers

### 1. **Tilth** (Meta/Production Layer)
- **Role:** The real production collective making the show
- **Aesthetic:** MIT-agrarian-ritual lab; philosophy disguised as farming
- **Method:** "We study systems by growing them"
- **Visual signature:** Soil textures, mycelium audio, Saul Bass minimalism
- **Opening card:** "TILTH" in sans-serif over microscopic soil photography

### 2. **Agronica** (Diegetic/In-World Company)
- **Role:** The tech company featured across all episodes
- **Product:** FarmOS — platform/OS powering an ecosystem of extraction apps
- **Founded:** 2041, post-pandemic ag-tech boom
- **Slogan evolution:** "Grow More" → "Grow Right" → "Grow Smart" → "Grow With Us" → "Grow Us"
- **Business model:** Sells "agrarian analytics" (surveillance data) to insurers, employers, governments

### 3. **FarmOS Apps** (Episode Subjects)
Each episode explores one app built on FarmOS infrastructure:

| Episode | App | Function | Ethical Dilemma |
|---------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | GrowthPath | Corporate learning | Pedagogy suppression |
| 2 | YieldMatch | AI dating | Algorithmic bias |
| 3 | TalentFarm | Hiring platform | Junior voice blocked |
| 4 | ConsentGarden | Data consent | Dark patterns |
| 5 | UnionSprout | Worker organizing (banned) | Collective action crushed |
| 6 | AutoGrow AI | ML infrastructure | Epistemic rush |
| 7 | MigrantHarvest | Visa tracking | Immigration-locked ethics |
| 8 | GlobalGrow | Enterprise edition | Geo-fenced principles |

## Connection to Ethics Archive

The **8 leaked documents** in the ethics archive (`/01-silenced-educator/` through `/08-values-treasurer/`) are the **source material** Tilth obtained from inside Agronica.

- **Geometric films** = Abstract visualization of the dilemma
- **Cinematic films** = 8-second emotional compression
- **Essays** = The actual internal documents (HR memos, legal reviews, incident reports)

**Narrative conceit:** Tilth obtained these documents and dramatized them into episodes.

---

## Episode Structure (Standard)

1. **[0:00-0:08]** Opening sequence (mycelium → soil → code → TILTH)
2. **[0:08-2:00]** Introduce the app — show FarmOS ecosystem working beautifully
3. **[2:00-8:00]** Meet the character(s) — someone encounters the ethical problem
4. **[8:00-18:00]** Watch the collapse — structural forces prevent resolution, harm scales
5. **[18:00-22:00]** The document — reveal the leaked internal memo (the essay from archive)
6. **[22:00-24:00]** Tilth investigators — researchers noting patterns, building larger case
7. **[24:00]** Cut to black, soil texture, next episode title card

---

## Visual System

### Tilth (Production)
- **Color:** Earth tones, matte textures, archival footage grain
- **Sound:** Contact mic recordings, environmental ambiance, minimal score
- **Typography:** Sans-serif, wide letter-spacing, all caps for titles

### Agronica (In-World Company)
- **Color:** Sterile greens (#5a6c57, #c8d4c0) + flesh pinks (#e8b4b8)
- **Sound:** Irrigation hiss + Slack notification (sound logo)
- **Architecture:** Glass vertical farms glowing like data centers
- **UI:** Pastoral aesthetics (plants, soil, growth) masking surveillance infrastructure

### FarmOS Apps
Each app has unique palette but shares:
- Garden/agricultural UI metaphors
- "Growth" language throughout
- Hidden surveillance metrics labeled as "soil health," "yield," "nutrient levels"

---

## Key Themes

1. **Infrastructure hides power** — FarmOS as platform enables all downstream harms
2. **Metaphor conceals violence** — Agricultural language makes extraction feel wholesome
3. **Systems reproduce patterns** — Same 8 dilemmas across different apps = structural, not individual
4. **Users are crops** — Gamification is literal: you're being harvested
5. **Compost is documentation** — Everything that decays (leaked docs) creates conditions for growth (accountability)

---

## Tone

- **Not cynical, not utopian** — shows systems honestly
- **Humor through absurdity** — the farm metaphors are ridiculous and precise
- **Vegetables as witnesses** — user avatars/crops are silent observers of their own exploitation
- **Tender but unsentimental** — respects characters caught in bad systems

---

## Production Notes

### Opening Sequence Specs
- **Duration:** 8 seconds exactly
- **Format:** 4K, 24fps, minimal color grading (preserve soil texture)
- **Audio:** Recorded on DPA 4060 contact mics on actual mycelium networks
- **Typography:** Custom typeface "Tilth Sans" — geometric, earthy, wide
- **Final frame:** Hold on "TILTH" for 1 full second before cut to black

### Episode Naming Convention
Episodes are titled after agricultural/tech terms that work both literally and metaphorically:
- "Nutrient Lock" (dependency)
- "First Fruit" (premature launch)
- "Apprentice Rows" (hierarchy)
- "Consent Harvest" (data extraction)
- "Root Union" (organizing)
- "Flood Learning" (information overload)
- "Conditional Harvest" (precarious labor)
- "Geo-Fencing the Garden" (regional ethics)
