# COURAGE: Trails and Reflections
> "The map is not the territory, but it is the record of our passage through it."

## Opening Statement
The **Courage Trail Map** is not merely a static archive of files; it is a *living visualization* of the intellectual journey undertaken during the project. It maps the topography of thought—from the foundational "Knowledge Hubs" to the high peaks of "WAG" and the deep valleys of "Skeleton Structure".

Every node represents a creation. Every line represents a connection. And the movement you see—the *Pilgrims*—represents the flow of attention and data that brings this system to life.

## Interface Guide

### 1. The Territory (Map View)
The visualization organizes work into **Zones** (e.g., *Narrative Ontology*, *Brick Haven*).
*   **Heatmap**: The background topography shows "heat"—areas of intense activity and density.
*   **Zones**: Colored circles represent clusters of related artifacts. Click any zone to open its **Dossier**, revealing the files, patterns, and decisions made there.

### 2. The Pilgrims (Walkers)
You will see small dots moving along the paths between zones. These are the **Pilgrims**.
*   **Representation**: They symbolize the active flow of context and logic between different parts of the system.
*   **Connections Toggle (⊶)**: You can sever these potential connections using the button in the top left.
    *   **Connected**: Pilgrims follow the established pathways, purposeful and fast.
    *   **Disconnected**: Without the trails, the Pilgrims *drift*. They slow down and wander aimlessly, simulating what happens to ideas when they lose their structural context—they get lost in the noise.

### 3. The Timeline & Reflections
The bottom of the screen features a chronological **Timeline** of the project.
*   **Playback (▶)**: Press play to watch the history unfold.
*   **AR Reflections**: As the timeline progresses, a **Reflection Stream** will appear above the active date.
    *   This "ghost in the machine" narration reveals the *Intent* and *Shift* behind the movement.
    *   It answers the question: *"Why did we move here?"* (e.g., transitioning from raw data to "Words Assemble Geometry").
    *   This text **physically attaches** to the timeline cursor, moving with time like an Augmented Reality annotation.

### 4. Reading the Map
*   **Start Here**: Inside each Zone's dossier, look for the **START HERE** badge. These artifacts (tutorials, explainers) are the best entry points for that region.
*   **Themes**: Toggle the Theme button (☀/☽) to switch between *Day Mode* (clean, paper-like) and *Night Mode* (cinematic, glowing).
