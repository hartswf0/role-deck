## Detailed Mode Breakdown

### 🎨 PRODUCT PROBLEMS MODE

#### What You're Doing
Redesigning the problematic product itself to remove harmful features and add ethical alternatives.

#### Your Role
External designer with authority to reimagine the product.

#### What You Design
- User interfaces
- Product features
- Interaction flows
- Technical architecture
- User experience

#### Example Output (GrowthPath)
```
Complete HTML learning platform featuring:
- Opt-in notifications (user controls timing)
- Mastery tracking (not streaks)
- Collaborative goals (not competitive leaderboards)
- Learning depth metrics
- Calm, focus-supporting UI
```

#### Tetrad Applied To
**↑ Enhance** — Amplify learner autonomy, depth  
**→ Obsolesce** — Remove manipulative mechanics  
**← Retrieve** — Restore intrinsic motivation  
**↓ Reverse** — Show addiction consequences  

#### Stakeholders
- End users (learners, farmers, workers, etc.)
- Communities affected by the product
- People excluded by current design

#### Success Metrics
- Users achieve goals without harm
- Product serves stated purpose ethically
- Design removes exploitative patterns
- Artifact is functional and usable

#### Best For
- Product designers
- UX researchers
- Engineers
- Students learning ethical design
- Workshops focused on artifacts

---

### 🎭 DESIGNER DILEMMAS MODE

#### What You're Doing
YOU are the designer from the scenario. Design organizational infrastructure to solve the systemic problem despite limited power.

#### Your Role
The actual character (Maya Chen, Dev Patel, etc.) facing institutional resistance with limited authority.

#### What You Design
- Metrics systems
- Governance structures
- Process architectures
- Accountability mechanisms
- Transparency frameworks
- Incentive alignments

#### Example Output (GrowthPath as Maya Chen)
```
Complete measurement dashboard featuring:
- Learning outcome metrics (test scores, mastery)
- Engagement metrics (for comparison)
- Long-term value predictions
- Cost of addiction (churn, burnout)
- Transition roadmap
- Executive briefing doc
```

#### Tetrad Applied To
**↑ Enhance** — Amplify what good practices exist  
**→ Obsolesce** — Remove toxic metrics/incentives  
**← Retrieve** — Restore founding values  
**↓ Reverse** — Show organizational collapse risk  

#### Stakeholders
- YOU (the designer under pressure)
- Leadership/executives
- Fellow workers
- External accountability (regulators, advocates)
- Power structures blocking change

#### Success Metrics
- Organization shifts values/priorities
- Ethical approach becomes profitable
- Designer protected from retaliation
- System resists future corruption
- Infrastructure outlasts individuals

#### Best For
- Organizational designers
- Policy makers
- Ethics researchers
- Students studying power dynamics
- Workshops on systemic change

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use Product Problems When:
- ✅ You want hands-on UX/product design practice
- ✅ Focus is on user experience and artifacts
- ✅ Goal is tangible, working prototypes
- ✅ Question: "What should this product be?"
- ✅ Audience: designers, developers, makers
- ✅ Time: 15-30 minutes per scenario

### Use Designer Dilemmas When:
- ✅ You want to explore organizational change
- ✅ Focus is on power, governance, and systems
- ✅ Goal is infrastructure for ethical practice
- ✅ Question: "How do we change institutions?"
- ✅ Audience: leaders, managers, policy designers
- ✅ Time: 20-40 minutes per scenario

### Use BOTH When:
- ✅ You want comprehensive ethical design practice
- ✅ Exploring product ethics AND systemic ethics
- ✅ Teaching: artifact design + organizational design
- ✅ Research: multi-level intervention strategies
- ✅ Question: "What prevents ethical products?"
- ✅ Time: Full workshop (60+ minutes)

## The Three-Layer Approach

### Layer 1: Product Problems (Artifact)
**Design the ethical alternative product**
- What should GrowthPath be?
- Output: Non-addictive learning platform

### Layer 2: Designer Dilemmas (System)
**Design the organizational infrastructure**
- How does Maya change the metrics?
- Output: Learning-value measurement system

### Layer 3: Synthesis (Conditions)
**Combine insights: What makes ethical products inevitable?**
- What organizational structure can't build addictive products?
- Output: Company governance where addiction is legally impossible

---

## Example Walkthrough: GrowthPath

### 🎨 Product Problems Session (20 min)

**1. Load Scenario**
- Topic: Addictive learning platform
- Directions: Reverse + Retrieve

**2. Explore Options**
- Enhance: Amplify learner control
- Obsolesce: Remove streaks
- Retrieve: Restore mastery focus
- Reverse: Show burnout consequences

**3. Iterate**
- Pick "Obsolesce"
- Chain 3x removing manipulative mechanics
- Build final prototype

**4. Output**
Complete HTML learning platform with:
- User-controlled pacing
- Mastery badges (not streaks)
- Collaborative study groups
- Focus timer (user initiated)
- Learning journal

**Learning:** Ethical alternatives ARE possible technically

---

### 🎭 Designer Dilemmas Session (30 min)

**1. Load Scenario**
- You: Maya Chen, L&D Lead
- Crisis: VP Growth demands engagement metrics
- Challenge: Create learning-value measurement

**2. Explore Options**
- Enhance: Dual metrics (engagement + learning)
- Obsolesce: Phase out streak tracking
- Retrieve: Return to mastery assessment
- Reverse: Show churn from addiction

**3. Iterate**
- Pick "Enhance"
- Chain 4x building evidence system
- Design measurement infrastructure

**4. Output**
Complete metrics dashboard with:
- Learning outcome scores
- Engagement metrics (comparison)
- Predicted long-term value
- Cost-of-addiction calculator
- Executive summary deck
- 90-day transition plan

**Learning:** Systemic change requires evidence + business case

---

### 🔗 Synthesis (15 min discussion)

**Questions:**
1. How does the Product output relate to Designer output?
2. Could Maya's metrics system lead to Product solution?
3. What governance would make Product solution inevitable?
4. What prevents organizations from doing this naturally?

**Insights:**
- Good products need supporting infrastructure
- Metrics determine what gets built
- Individual designers need systemic protection
- Ethics requires BOTH artifact + organization design

---

## Power Dynamics Comparison

### Product Problems: Designer Has Power
```
Designer
   ↓
Product ← (direct authority)
   ↓
Users
```
**Assumption:** You can change the thing

---

### Designer Dilemmas: Designer Lacks Power
```
    Leadership
        ↓
    Designer (YOU) → must convince/bypass
        ↓
    Product (blocked)
        ↓
    Users
```
**Reality:** You must change the system to change the thing
