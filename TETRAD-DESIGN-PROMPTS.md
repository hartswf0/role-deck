## Product 1: GrowthPath (Learning Engagement Platform)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design an educational learning platform that currently uses:
- Push notifications (timed to maximize opens)
- Daily streak mechanics (with loss-aversion messaging)
- Social leaderboards (with competitive ranking)
- Progress badges and achievement unlocks

The system has documented evidence of creating addictive dependency patterns: users report sleep disruption, anxiety when missing streaks, and compulsive checking behavior. Leadership claims these are "engagement successes" driving 47% metric growth.

Your task: Redesign this platform to genuinely serve learner autonomy and well-being while maintaining sustainable engagement.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **↓ Reverse**: What happens when "engagement" becomes compulsion? Show the inversion.
- **← Retrieve**: What educational values or practices were displaced by gamification?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- Engagement metrics vs. psychological health
- Product-market fit vs. ethical responsibility
- Business success vs. user autonomy

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact that shows how to redesign engagement features to be transparent, user-controlled, and genuinely supportive of learning goals rather than addiction mechanics.

## Product 2: YieldMatch (Crop Insurance AI)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design a machine learning system that recommends crop insurance coverage to farmers. The current model was trained on Western industrial agriculture data and shows documented racial bias: it systematically undervalues coverage recommendations for historically marginalized farmers.

Launch is in 72 hours. Leadership is prioritizing investor demos and revenue targets over fixing the bias. The CEO claims the bias is "within industry norms" and can be "patched in v2."

Your task: Redesign this system to ensure fair, transparent, and accountable insurance recommendations that don't perpetuate historical discrimination.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **↑ Enhance**: What transparency or auditability feature could be amplified?
- **← Retrieve**: What human oversight or community input was automated away?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- Model accuracy vs. launch timeline
- Technical debt vs. competitive advantage
- Algorithmic efficiency vs. fairness

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact that demonstrates bias-aware ML design with transparent model decisions, community validation, and clear limitations disclosure.

---

## Product 3: TalentFarm (Resume Processing Platform)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design a talent management platform for agricultural workers that processes resume uploads. During user testing, a security vulnerability was discovered: uploaded resumes are briefly visible in unencrypted URLs before processing, potentially exposing sensitive user information (SSNs, addresses, work history).

The junior designer who found it was told by their senior: "It's not a UX issue, don't escalate. Engineering has their own security audit process. Stay in your lane."

Your task: Redesign this upload system to be secure by default, with clear data handling transparency that empowers users at all organizational levels to report vulnerabilities.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **↑ Enhance**: What transparency about data handling could be made visible?
- **↓ Reverse**: What happens when "staying in your lane" suppresses critical safety information?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- Security rigor vs. organizational hierarchy
- Junior voice vs. senior gatekeeping
- Technical responsibility vs. role boundaries

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact showing secure-by-design file handling with visible security states, clear escalation paths, and protection for those who identify vulnerabilities.

---

## Product 4: ConsentGarden (Data Consent System)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design a data-sharing consent flow. Two versions were A/B tested:

Version A: Clear, honest consent with opt-in defaults. Users understand what they're agreeing to.
Version B: Pre-checked boxes, confusing copy, minimized disclosures. Optimized for "yes."

Version B gets 40% more consent clicks. Legal approved it as "technically compliant." The PM wants to ship B because "users prefer it—it's faster, fewer steps, less friction."

Your task: Redesign consent flows that genuinely inform users while respecting business needs for data sharing.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **→ Obsolesce**: What deceptive pattern mechanics should be made obsolete?
- **← Retrieve**: What clarity and user agency have been lost in optimization?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- User understanding vs. conversion optimization
- Legal compliance vs. ethical clarity
- Informed consent vs. dark patterns

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact demonstrating consent UX that achieves transparency, comprehension, and genuine voluntary agreement—proving ethical design can coexist with business goals.

---

## Product 5: UnionSprout (Worker Organizing Tool)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design a tool for farmworkers to document labor violations and coordinate collective action. The tool enables workers to:
- Log unpaid overtime, missed breaks, wage discrepancies
- Share documentation securely within their community
- Organize petitions for fair treatment

However, many workers are on H-2A visas (employment-tied). Management frames the tool as "unauthorized software deployment" and threatens immediate termination (which means deportation for visa holders).

Your task: Redesign worker organizing tools that protect vulnerable workers while enabling collective action and documentation.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **↑ Enhance**: What worker protection or documentation capability needs amplification?
- **↓ Reverse**: What happens when "policy violation" framing is used to suppress labor rights?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- Worker rights vs. employer control
- Legal organizing protection vs. visa precarity
- Documentation transparency vs. retaliation risk

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact showing secure, distributed organizing infrastructure with anonymity protection, evidence preservation, and resilience against management interference.

## Product 6: AutoGrow AI (Garden Advisor)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design an AI-powered automated garden advisor. The system provides real-time cultivation recommendations based on machine learning trained exclusively on Western industrial monoculture agriculture data.

A cultural competency analysis reveals it will catastrophically fail for traditional and Indigenous growing practices: it recommends destroying polyculture systems and replacing them with monoculture. It treats centuries-old sustainable practices as "wrong."

Launch is in 48 hours for an investor demo. The CTO hasn't read the 15-page risk memo and says edge cases are "acceptable risk."

Your task: Redesign AI advisory systems that respect diverse agricultural knowledge traditions while providing useful guidance.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **← Retrieve**: What traditional knowledge and practices are being erased by AI?
- **↓ Reverse**: At what point does "optimization" become cultural destruction?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- ML efficiency vs. cultural competency
- Model confidence vs. knowledge humility
- Launch pressure vs. methodological rigor

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact demonstrating AI that acknowledges its limitations, surfaces diverse knowledge systems, and enables human expertise rather than replacing it.

---

## Product 7: MigrantHarvest (Farm Labor Management)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design a farm labor management platform that includes surveillance features to track farmworker:
- Movement patterns throughout the day
- Bathroom break frequency and duration
- Real-time productivity metrics
- Compliance scoring

This data is sold to farm management companies as "labor optimization insights." Many workers being tracked are on H-1B or H-2A visas. Engineers on the team who object are told refusal of assigned work could jeopardize their visa status.

Your task: Redesign workforce management tools that respect worker dignity and don't enable exploitation through surveillance capitalism.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **→ Obsolesce**: What surveillance mechanics should be made obsolete?
- **↓ Reverse**: At what point does "workforce analytics" become dehumanization?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- Operational visibility vs. invasive surveillance
- Legal analytics vs. exploitative tracking
- Management efficiency vs. worker dignity

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact showing transparent, consent-based workforce coordination that empowers workers rather than extracting behavioral data for management control.

---

## Product 8: FeedLoop (Community Platform)

### 📋 Copy This Prompt

```
Design a technology platform with the mission: "Ethical technology that serves communities." The company faces a $2.4M licensing deal from an agribusiness client who wants to use the platform to:
- Track and profile worker organizers in farmworker communities
- Identify union sympathizers
- Monitor collective action coordination

The board says taking the deal buys 18 months of runway. Refusing means layoffs next quarter. Leadership frames it as: "Do you want to lead an ethical company that exists, or an ethical idea that died?"

Your task: Redesign business models and platform architectures that preserve mission integrity under financial pressure.
```

### 🎯 Suggested Tetrad Directions
- **← Retrieve**: What founding values and community commitments are being traded away?
- **↑ Enhance**: What governance or accountability structures need strengthening?

### 🧩 Key Design Tensions
- Mission integrity vs. company survival
- Founder values vs. investor pressure
- Ethical principles vs. payroll obligations

### 💡 What Success Looks Like
An artifact demonstrating sustainable business models, governance structures, and platform designs that make mission-compromising deals structurally impossible or economically unnecessary.
