ABSTRACT
HCI and STS researchers have previously described the ethical
complexity of practice, drawing together aspects of organizational
complexity, design knowledge, and ethical frameworks. Building
on this work, we investigate the identity claims and beliefs that
impact practitioners’ ability to recognize and act upon ethical concerns in a range of technology-focused disciplines. In this paper,
we report results from an interview study with 12 practitioners,
identifying and describing their identity claims related to ethical
awareness and action. We conducted a critically-focused thematic
analysis to identify eight distinct claims representing roles relating to learning, educating, following policies, feeling a sense of
responsibility, being a member of a profession, a translator, an activist, and deliberative. Based on our findings, we demonstrate how
the claims foreground building competence in relation to ethical
practice. We highlight the dynamic interplay among these claims
and point towards implications for identity work in socio-technical
contexts.

notions of responsibility are oriented towards the practitioners that
create these design outcomes by calling out technology impacts on
society, motivating the need for ethically responsible work before
society is “ruined by design” [31]. Substantial prior work has sought
to support the ethically-focused work of practitioners, including
the creation and dissemination of design methods [12, 13, 49], definition and operationalization of codes of ethics [1], and the creation
of public initiatives [26] and manifestos [32]. We seek to extend
this knowledge base, focusing on describing what guides or shapes
the ways that practitioners think about their work and how they
choose or are able to act.
Previous scholarship has provided evidence that technology practitioners across a wide range of roles inscribe ethics into their designed outcomes [13, 21, 34, 50] and must address a wide range
of ethically- and organizationally-complex issues that impact the
translation of ethical awareness to ethical action [22]. Recent research in the HCI community has sought to define the dimensions of
technology practice that relate to issues of ethical complexity, using
practice-led approaches to define this awareness on the practitioners’ own terms [10, 22, 40, 43]. While this prior work has provided
a more substantial understanding of the contexts and complexity
that drive ethically-focused work, relatively little is known about
the beliefs and attitudes that these practitioners bring to their work,
and how these beliefs might shape ethical awareness and action.
In this study, we seek to identify and describe the core beliefs
of practitioners that guide their ethical awareness, focusing on the
language of their identity claims. To access these identity claims,
we conducted 60–90 minute semi-structured critically-focused interviews with twelve technology practitioners, with the goal of
explore the ethical considerations, challenges, experiences, and
knowledge that guided their everyday work. While identity claims
are representative of how individuals wish to perform, the environments they are placed in determines how this performance
emerges and is shaped, and how behavior is thereby regulated or
mediated. Thus, by identifying the beliefs that serve as precursors
for practitioners’ actions, we are able to document the potential
interplay of these subjective and normative forces, leading to a
more nuanced understanding of how beliefs may lead to or impact
ethical action. Through a critically-focused thematic analysis, we
identified a set of eight relevant identity claims, including desiring to: learn ethics-focused knowledge, be an educator of ethics
to their co-workers, translate their knowledge into decisions or
organizational change, be a policy follower of existing normative
structures, practice as a member of profession in performing ethics
CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Chivukula, et al.
as defined by their discipline, be an activist or advocate that has a
sense of responsibility towards the outcomes they create, and be
deliberative about their ethical stance with stakeholders. This work
reveals both the complexity of experiences and beliefs that exist
prior to action, and the interactions among these identity claims
that point towards identity work—where practitioners perform and
evolve their identity over time in relation to their ethical standpoint
and character.
The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we identify the
identity claims that technology practitioners take on and attribute
to themselves in relation to their professional practices, providing
a rich description of the core beliefs and motivations that underlie
their actions and may point towards more complex accounts of educational preparation and everyday professional work. Second, we
provide insights into the potential complexity that forms through
interactions among the identity claims based on practitioners’ roles,
which extends current work on ethical design complexity and points
toward future research on identity work and the performance of
ethically-bound beliefs.
2 BACKGROUND WORK
2.1 Performance and Competence of (Ethical)
Practice
As part of a “turn-to-practice,” a portion of HCI scholarship has
sought to describe the work of designers and technologists on their
own terms, highlighting the complex and pragmatic knowledge
that exists in professional practice [16, 17, 19, 30, 38]. Within this
practice-led tradition, scholars have identified mechanisms that
practitioners use to share and perform methods [16, 20, 37], develop
and maintain their competence over time [19, 24], and perform their
design identity [51]. This landscape of practice-focused work has
led to a better understanding of the complexity of professional
preparation, the need to constantly evolve one’s own knowledge
to maintain a sense of felt competence, and an acknowledgement
of organizational and professional factors that lead to the performance and suppression of one’s own design identity [51]. Thus,
we frame professional work as situated, contingent, and subjective;
within this space, we acknowledge the complexity of organizational
and professional structures, but focus on the designer themself, including the knowledge they build and their capability to engage
in their work in relation to this knowledge [47]. In this paper, we
consider our approach of interviewing practitioners from different
disciplinary roles to be “practice-led” [30], building on prior work
that seeks to describe practice on its own terms. Our interview
protocol focused on stimulated recall and continual reflection to
elicit the participants’ past and present professional experiences,
with a focus both on practitioners’ everyday work practices and
the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences that shaped or were otherwise motivated by these practices. Our analytic focus in this
paper is on practitioners’ beliefs that are ontologically prior to action, but these beliefs can be seen as strongly connected to both
the articulation and performance of these beliefs in practice. As a
research team, we deconstructed ethically-nuanced instances provided by participants to identify their beliefs, expressed as identity
claims, that were manifest in their professional experience. While
different from observation of practice in situ, these findings are
equally useful in describing participants’ identity commitments in
a practice-grounded framing.
In this paper, we particularly focus on this dimension of practice
within the context of ethical knowledge and action, building on a
rich tradition of studying these practices in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and HCI. Most prominent is the practice-focused
work of Friedman and colleagues [13], motivating the framework
and methods contained within the Value Sensitive Design (VSD)
methodology. This work has been built upon by numerous scholars,
with the goal of identifying and disseminating resources to support
ethically-focused work practices. We particularly build on the extensive line of research by Shilton and colleagues [39, 40, 42–44]
that has investigated the role of contingent practices in relation
to ethics and values, focusing on design practice that determines
the complex nature of practice from organizational, methods, and
differing roles of professions. In this trajectory of work, Shilton has
revealed the complex arrangement of activities that bring together
organizational and team structures [40, 43], methods and means of
action [39, 44], and the differing roles of members of technology
professions [42]. Gray, Chivukula, and colleagues have built on
this framing of ethically-focused design and technology work, revealing the degree to which designers must negotiate and mediate
the ethical design complexity of everyday practice, encompassing
organizational structures, applied ethics and knowledge of ethical
practices, and personal values, commitments, and practices [22].
Chivukula et al. [10] reveal a range of dimensions that impact these
practices in further detail, describing the role of UX positionality, conflicts and balancing during decision making, prioritization
of design activities, means of self and stakeholder education, and
the capacity to engage in futuring as key aspects of building and
maintaining ethical awareness. In this paper, we build upon these
complex views of practice, focusing our attention on the designer
themselves—seeking to reveal the identity claims the designer takes
on or believes that impacts all of these outward-facing capacities
that have been documented in prior work.
2.2 Identity Claims and Identity Work
The study of “identity,” “self” or “self concept” has been extensively
studied in the humanities, social and cognitive psychology as the
psycho-analysis of “self” [14], organizational management studies
[7], design theory [33, 48], and political science [35]. This brief
review gathers definitions of “identity” across its types and multiple theories as proposed in these fields, aiding us in building our
conceptual vocabulary for this paper. Identity claims are defined as
the “meanings that individuals attach reflexively to themselves, and
developed and sustained through processes of social interaction as
they seek to address the question ‘who am I?”’[7]; and “people’s
concepts of who they are, of what sort of people they are, and
how they relate to others” [2]. Across many definitions, it is understood that an identity claim of a person is "a reflexively organized
endeavor” [3] through social standards (e.g. gender, nationality),
personal standards (e.g. physical appearance, philosophy, beliefs)
and role-based standards (e.g. teacher, researcher). We build on
these multiple theories of identity to define our working definition of “identity” for this paper. This is brings two categories of
theories: social identity theory and identity theory. According to
Identity Claims that Underlie Ethical Awareness and Action CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan
social identity theory, “people [make] social comparisons between
in-group and out-group, or between self as in-grouper and other as
out-grouper, in order to construct a sense of who they are and how
they are evaluated”[27]. According to this theory, social identity
is claimed through the influence or engagement in “relationships
between groups, self identity, and social behavior” [28] and “[a] person’s sense of who he or she is in a setting” [52]. In social collective
form, identity claims are defined as “speech acts that concern what
the social collective is or does – and negotiations on whether or not
these claims have been made on the collective’s behalf” [11]. Stets
and Burke’s work [46] differentiates social identity theory from
identity theory where “the core of an identity is the categorization
of the self as an occupant of a role, and the incorporation, into the
self, of the meanings and expectations associated with that role
and its performance.” From a methodological perspective in identifying an identity claim, Gray, Toombs, and McKay [25] defined
an identity claim as “a combination of a subjective and normative
claim—something that is implicitly claimed as part of the identity
of the person in a subjectively normative sense, representing one’s
personal involvement in reproducing and shaping a social context.” In a design context, Tracey and Hutchinson [48] present work
about how a designer develops her professional identity and “their
individual characteristics with the duties, values, and territory of
the profession,” defining identity as a member of a profession with
disciplinary connotations.
Given the performative nature of a person’s identity and the
situated and evolving nature of a profession’s identity (see [29]
for such an evolution in the profession of UX), we build on these
multiple perspectives of social, personal, and role components to
create our working definition. For example, Bjorklund et al. [4]
defined a designer’s identity as “a (discursively) constructed understanding of oneself as a designer.” Here, it is important that a
designer’s self identity is explored, but a designer also exists as
a role in a social setting of the profession it bears (in a team or
organization). We draw from this perspective, Gray, Toombs, &
McKay’s definition [25], and Brown’s [7] definition of identity in
an organization: “people’s subjectively constructed understandings
of who they were, are and desire to become, are implicated in, and
thus key to understanding and explaining, almost everything that
happens in and around organizations.”
In this paper, we take a similar approach in working to combine the social, personal, and role-based identity claims in order to
describe identity claims in relation to their role (as a technology
practitioner), the social elements of that role (team or organizational), and their understanding of self (a manifestation of their
constructed identity). We view all three of these elements in relation to their potential ethical practice as evidenced by their own
self-reported claims and actions. Taking a practice-led approach,
we focus on how practitioners claim their identity in relation to
ethical concerns they describe in their everyday practice and how
that particularly claimed identity is performed.
We also set out multiple paths that we will not address in this
work—in particular, the activation of an organizational identity (defined as “what people perceive as an organization’s attributes” and
an organizations classification under social and industrial sectors
[36]), and the performance of one’s identity in a context as a form
of “identity work” (defined as “the range of activities individuals
engage in to create, present, and sustain personal identities that are
congruent with and supportive of the self-concept”[45]). The actual
interaction between identity claims and practice (encapsulated by
the concept of “identity work”) is suggested as future work to build
on the identity claims we describe in this paper. We specifically
delimit our scope to the practitioner themself, and do not seek to
elaborate the practitioner’s identity in relation to their organization
or provide observational evidence regarding how a certain claimed
identity is actually performed in their professional practice (cf.,
Goffman’s presentation of the self [15]).
3 OUR APPROACH
To identify and describe identity claims of technology practitioners with respect to their professional practice, we have used a
narrative-based approach to identify the complex and ethicallynuanced experiences through twelve 60–90 minute semi-structured
critical interviews. We then conducted a critically-focused thematic
analysis, building on the reflexive nature of thematic analysis [5]
in general and inferences regarding meaning-making and identity
claims from meaning re-construction practices [25] in particular.
We specifically focused on documenting the identity claims of
these practitioners in relation to felt ethical design complexity
[22] in their everyday practice, answering the following research
question: What identity claims did technology practitioners present
or express as they reflected on their engagement in ethically complex
work? In the following sub-sections, we present our approach by
detailing the sampling strategy, participants, data collection, and
data analysis process to answer this research question.
3.1 Sampling Strategy
A recruitment screener was distributed to the research team’s personal and professional networks, as well as social networking sites
such as Twitter and LinkedIn. We also encouraged snowball sampling based on the initial interviewees to build our participant pool,
including a range of company types and practitioner roles. Our
inclusion criteria included any design and technology practitioners who are currently employed in roles that include (but are not
limited to): User Experience (UX), Data Science, Front/Back-end
Development, Product Management, and other design personnel
responsible for the development of digital systems in any industry
or governmental context. We explicitly sought to sample practitioners to represent a diverse sample based on gender identity, current
job role, current company type (enterprise, B2B, B2C, startup), and
years of industry experience, details of which are included in Table 1.
3.2 Participants
We conducted 60–90 minute semi-structured interviews with twelve
practitioners. The participants formed a diverse sample in terms of
company size and type, practitioner role and gender identity, with
an equal division of junior and senior practitioners. Table 1 details
the demographic characteristics of the participants. Anonymous
numerical identifiers (e.g., SP01) were used to ensure confidentiality and reduce discoverability of the participants’ identities. The
number of years of experience of the participants ranged from
CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Chivukula, et al.
2–20+ years, and the roles captured included: UX Designer, Software Engineer, Product Manager, CEO, and CTO. The company
types represented in the sample ranged across Enterprise (B2B),
Enterprise (B2B2C), Agency/Consultancy, Research Center, and
Freelance. From the examples and experiences shared by the participants, we were able to identify a range of design and technology
outputs from these practitioners, including: interaction design artifacts, algorithmic/code outputs, game designs, animated character
designs, AI-based designs, and research opportunities. The geographic regions of the organizations our participants are currently
a part of are placed in the US (n=9), UK (n=1), and India (n=2), and
over half of our participants had professional or educational experiences in more than one geographic context. This variety and range
of participant demographics resulted in a robust dataset through
which we identified and described identity claims across practitioners in a range of ethically complex situations and contexts.
3.3 Researcher Positionality
The process of data collection and analysis was conducted by two
graduate and three undergraduate student researchers, supervised
by the primary investigator. All researchers were experienced and
trained in qualitative research methods through previous research
projects and coursework and had professional experiences in industry through full-time or internship positions through which
they could relate to and evaluate stories shared by the participants.
Given the complex nature of analysis in revealing hidden or tacit
identity claims, we conducted a series of sensitization exercises (detailed below) throughout the analysis process to ensure alignment,
validity, and rigor. The research team sought to be reflexive and
iterative in their approach throughout the coding process, regularly
performing member checking and discussing points of difference
or confusion amongst themselves and with the principal investigator. The researchers maintained memos throughout the process to
support and facilitate the generation of a codebook and final theme
write-ups, increasing team alignment and producing an audit trail
that led to final outcomes.
3.4 Data Collection
We conducted 60–90 minute semi-structured interviews with twelve
practitioners. Using a critical qualitative interview protocol approach [8], our protocol focused on identifying the ethical considerations, experiences, challenges and knowledge that guided the
practitioner’s everyday work. We did not provide any guiding definition of ethics, values, or related terms to our participants before,
during, or after the interviews, and instead sought to build on a
practice-oriented and grounded approach. We began each interview with an open-ended question asking about the participants
to describe a time they felt ethically uncomfortable in their professional experiences, without directing them towards a particular
framing of ethics. We proceeded to ask the participants open-ended
questions under three main topic domains: 1) identification of the
practitioner’s personal values by asking them to recall an instance
from their past where they encountered an ethically uncomfortable situation; 2) reflection of ethical decision making strategies
by probing hypothetical prompts about their past practices; and 3)
proposing opportunities for ethics-focused support for their current
or future practice. The interview protocol focused on stimulated
recall and reflection that helped us gain a deeper understanding of
the practitioner’s past, current, and potential future experiences of
ethical awareness and action or situations that framed participants’
individual perception of ethics, helping us identify aspects of complexity that may point towards the ways in which their ethical role
is mediated in their current job role. Because the use of stimulated
recall has inherent limitations, we used construct-focused questions to identify each practitioner’s approach to ethical awareness
and action, using the range of examples they provided to inform
a broad sense of how they interpreted ethics, their professional
commitments, and disjunctures between beliefs and action in past
or present professional or personal experiences. Each interview was
voice recorded with the participant’s consent (as approved by our
institutional review board) and fully transcribed. These transcripts
were carefully cleaned to remove any verbal clutter and anonymize
any identifiable participant or employer information.
3.5 Data Analysis
Our analysis was conducted over a series of four iterative rounds
over a two month period, supported by collaborative efforts and
discussion among the entire research team. We have built on the reflexive methodology of thematic analysis [5] to engage in criticallyfocused issues relating to identity claims as described in following
stages:
3.5.1 Familiarization with Data. We started the analysis by making
ourselves familiar with the data. This was conducted by openly
coding of three initial transcripts (SP03, SP04, SP05), with each
researcher coding two transcripts. We selected these transcripts
based on the varied participant descriptors and their professional
experiences. After initial open coding, the three researchers came
together with the principal investigator to discuss the open codes.
We identified various potential themes including: attitudes towards
their identity, dimensions of identity work, ethical dilemmas they
face in practice, and development of professional maturity over time.
Our participants shared a range of ethical dilemmas and ethical
issues that had both positive and negative impacts on their practice.
Although not the focus of this paper, these dilemmas and issues
included: applied ethics in relation to designed products, organizational ethics in relation to labor policies or following prescribed
compliance, and individual ethics in relation to personal values
and attitudes towards their involvement with ethical dilemmas.
From the examples of ethical issues or dilemmas shared with us
and interaction trajectories (as analyzed and presented in Figure 1),
not all participants related themselves to ethics in the same way.
We focused our analysis on practitioners’ sense-making relating to
ethical awareness and action, including how they identify themselves in relation to their notions of everyday ethical practice as
expressed through their examples of these everyday ethical issues.
Our current work does not claim to contribute directly to knowledge of practices, but rather focuses on the identity claims that are
ontologically prior to these practices. We chose to focus specifically on the identity claims of these practitioners, allowing us to
identify internal beliefs that builds upon active and performative
components of ethical deliberation revealed by prior scholarship.

3.5.2 Identifying Identity Claims. After narrowing our research
purpose to surface the various identity positions claimed by these
practitioners, we performed sensitization exercises to align ourselves and clearly frame what we would characterize as an identity claim. We identified identity claims as the practitioner’s (role)
means of claiming their identity in relation to a team or organizational setting (social), connecting their constructed identity (self)
to the ethical valence of their practice. We understand that identity
is performative in nature and for the purpose of this analysis, have
backgrounded the performance of these identities and propose future work in relation to identity work. To clarify and operationalize
this definition, we began by analyzing two transcripts from the
previous round, identifying all instances which illustrated a pattern
of “being and doing” [9] for these participants. We marked the following linguistic structures as candidate identity claims: any “I. . .”
statements, any statements about their subjective stance in relation
to a job-related situation in a professional environment, and any
statements about their ability to act in a professional setting. We
excluded statements regarding aspirational identity claims, or expressed needs in supporting or building their identity. We identified
identity claims across all topic domains throughout the transcript,
and frequently had to connect multiple instances to narrow to a
specific and precise identity claim.
3.5.3 Formulating the Codebook. Building on the sensitization exercise, we conducted a critically-focused thematic analysis—combining
elements of a reflexive, bottom-up thematic analysis [5] and recognition of the performative nature of ethics as defined in critical
theory. In this initial identification of candidate identity claims,
some identity claims were more dominant and easily recognizable
as linguistic forms, while others were higher in inference, demonstrated as patterns of reasoning, beliefs, or ways of being within and
across multiple interview transcripts. All claims were continuously
discussed and validated through memoing during the interview and
coding process. We finalized a codebook of identity claims through
this thematic analysis process, which is presented in Table 2.
3.5.4 Thematic Coding. Using the codebook in Table 2, we conducted confirmatory coding as our final round of analysis. We coded
the twelve transcripts to identify the identity claims from the codebook and build insights regarding the use and function of these
claims which we present in the results section. Due to the relatively
small number of participants, we do not seek to represent each
participant by their apparently dominant identity claims, but rather
describing how practitioners with a particular identity claim or
set of identity claims act or perform alongside their intentions to
perform that claim in their everyday work. Through the use of examples, we identified examples of “how” and “why” the participants
have claimed a particular aspect of their identity, which we will
expand upon in the findings section.
4 FINDINGS
Based on our analysis approach, we present the identity claims
relating to ethics that are posed by practitioners in relation to their
everyday work. We outline the qualities and actions that represent
each identity claim and describe the intentions, constitutive elements, and motivations that guide them. We limit our scope to the
internal existence of these claims within practitioners, and do not
seek to fully define or validate the performance of these claims,
which may be revealed through the concept of identity work.
4.1 I am a Learner
“I am a learner” as an identity claim represents practitioners who
recognize that their current knowledge is insufficient and thus they
need to improve their capabilities over time. Practitioners need to
first “[understand] what your role is and what you can do and cannot
do” and then find ways to “equip [themselves] with the right set of
knowledge”(SP08) by incorporating external resources and internal
reflections. External resources that practitioners seek out in order
to develop and advance their knowledge include mentors “who were
going to tell me why it is important to ask this question. And helping
me, in some cases, they help me with the choice of words as well”(SP13);
attending ethics-focused design workshops (SP03, SP07) and reading published material such as “watching congressional hearings
on privacy and tech and ethics and dark patterns”(SP07); as well as
participating in the mandatory employee training programs that
provide a direct exposure for junior practitioners to standard industry practices, guidelines and values the company leverages (SP03,
CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Chivukula, et al.

I have a Sense of my Responsibility I consider the current and future impact of my work.

SP08). While practitioners actively seek out external learning resources, they do not always “get all the information in one go;” as
SP11 notes, “learning is [a] gradual process.” As a product manager,
SP11 reflected that “it’s really as you grow, as you get exposed, as
you get more responsibility, as your role grows from just building on
small things, components on the application to basically look at the
whole system level, that’s when [he] thinks [his] learning started to
grow bigger and wider”.
Such learning requires supportive practices and the desire to
internalize the external knowledge, reflect and challenge their own
decisions, and eventually be able to translate the learning to impact
their everyday work. As SP04 said, “a lot of what [they are] doing is
learning and just expressing things that [they] have learned along the
way”, and as a junior practitioner, she internalizes these training
sessions on creating inclusive accessible content, placing diversity and inclusion as one of her core priorities when she “creates
design, research and supports projects that [she is] a part of.” Learners expressed their motivations for taking on this identity claim,
many of which are concerned with their professional presence or
development—where they are often required to participate in company training programs and they know that they will be evaluated
on their ability to translate their learning into their work (SP03).
Practitioners also expressed intentions of learning knowledge on
design ethics or recent updates on ethical awareness as a part of
their interest or sense of responsibility to improve their ethical decision making and negotiation with their co-workers (SP07). Apart
from learning about ethics, practitioners expressed their learning
as a part of their competency-building over their time in practice
with the goal of identifying product standards from past projects
“to make sure that there’s no dark pattern use” (SP12) and awareness
about the kind of companies she wants to work for to engage in
ethical practices (SP11).
4.2 I am an Educator
“I am an educator” as an identity claim represents practitioners who
seek to share their knowledge with others. They intend to educate
others through explicit actions such as conducting presentations
with organization members; encouraging other team members to
engage in the “word ‘ethics’” and other related ethical and legal
topics; or having one-to-one conversations with their colleagues
about sensitive ethical issues. SP07 shared her educator experiences
when she “made a concerted effort to have a what we call a ‘lunch
and learn’; anyone can present a ‘lunch and learn’ on anything that
they’re passionate about. And so I was given an hour time slot to make
a presentation. And my goal was to make the idea of what I focused
on data privacy specifically in this presentation, because I wanted to
do a second round for dark patterns and ethics, but I wanted to start
from that legal standpoint.” This educator planned to engage other
team members in related topics in ethics and be a representative
to build legal vocabulary into design discussions. Educators also
tended to educate their team members by sharing resources, as
shared by SP05 where he as a developer felt it was important to
share examples that “tend to educate people [team members]; we
share some articles sometimes about what happened with so and
so company because their product got hacked, and what was the
loss to their reputation” and treat that education as a way to build
awareness that “something bad can really happen.” Another rare
example, which acts as a negative example outside of professional
settings and exemplifies the art of signaling was shared by SP06;
she hopes to implicitly educate and change others’ actions about
environmentally sustainable practices through her own actions: “if
more people had seen me at the grocery store with my grocery bags
[not plastic], they would have been inspired to do the same thing.”
Educators shared their motivations in improving their collective understanding of ethics of design artifacts and making others
aware of individual professionals’ rights in a work environment.
Educators wanted to build awareness among others in the team to
metaphorically “invite them to the party” (SP07), to share practical
knowledge to facilitate reflection about “the importance of [ethics]
by speaking about what kinds of things happen when you don’t have
security” (SP05) and having seen others “started paying more attention to it.” SP07 shared her educator motivations as a designer
who is interested in ethics, stating that she “wanted to invite them
to start thinking about [ethics] in their own work to start getting
excited about it [. . . ] how can I start to change the way that I think
in my work and how can I contribute to this?” Educators mentioned
a desire to build those conversations among their team members
and fellow practitioners and make the whole experience of sharing
knowledge “not scary. And I wanted to make it not burdensome to
our goals” (SP07). Additionally, SP07 mentioned her intention to
translate legal texts that may not be equally accessible to everyone:
“not just any designer can do this because, I had the stamina to care
Identity Claims that Underlie Ethical Awareness and Action CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan
about looking at legal text, [but] not everybody can look through
that stuff.” Apart from sharing knowledge about values inscribed
in design artifacts, there were instances where educators took the
role to build or guide fellow team members through professional
ethics training to amplifying each other’s voices or better respect
co-workers during meetings and discussions.
4.3 I am a Translator
“I am a translator” as an identity claim represents practitioners who
seek to translate the knowledge they have gained into their everyday work. Practitioners identified this translational work occurring
at both a personal level as well as across teams and organizational
structures. At a personal level, practitioners found themselves translating their past learning across future roles by learning techniques
of reading legal texts to advocate for unethical discussion by using
legal references with higher management (SP07), applying ethical
concepts or policies (e.g., GDPR) they had learned about in their
decision making about compliance (SP14), developing a familiarity
with their user groups to translate those emotions to inspire their
work (SP02), implementing training provided in organization workshops into design decisions on accessibility (SP03), and improving
their professional communication and presentation based on “the
background knowledge of design [that] helps me to translate those
qualitative needs into a form factor, which is understandable by
my audience here, which is PMs, designers, and developers” (SP04).
At an organizational level, practitioners frequently mentioned reevaluating their company’s portfolio of projects accumulated over
time to continuously revise and develop internal checklists (SP12)
and enhancing the process of decision making by dealing with ethical issues “as part of the process and not as afterthought” from past
mistakes (SP11).
Translators shared that they are either self-motivated or incentivized through organizational practices. Practitioners were selfmotivated to acquire and translate new knowledge in their everyday
work as mentioned by SP11: “[I] educate myself and then apply that
knowledge in the domain that I’m working on.” SP09 also drew on
their past experiences in order to be a representative for the users
and employees: “I was representing people of color and women,
so at least, and I had a lived experience that I could share,” Other
examples included a practitioner that empowered their teams by
providing a space to share any issue openly, and a rare case was
illustrated with SP06 who was self-motivated to offset the impact of
her professional work of being a developer dealing with data centers by compensating with her personal habits: “I think I’ve tried to
keep my carbon footprint minimized. But I think as time went on at
[a previous multi-national oil and gas company], I definitely did it a
lot more.” Translators were incentivized as a part of organizational
professional training and assessment as shared by SP03: “I’ve [. . . ]
completing certain training and earning accessibility badges through
the [Current Employer] platforms. I have attended different trainings
and workshops. And then, a part of our product has to do with like
meeting grade C level.”
4.4 I am a Member of my Profession
“I am a member of my profession” as an identity claim identifies practitioners as they represent the beliefs, values, and activities of their
profession as defined by its disciplinary rhetoric. Due to the variety
of roles of our participants, this identity claim is heterogeneous in
nature, covering a substantial breadth of responsibilities per role.
First, we identify discipline-based activities as those that are described and undertaken by these practitioners which constrains or
defines what kind of actions one can take in their everyday work.
These roles represent their position and expertise across their professional experiences, and is not always specific to their current role
or title;, however, we highlight how their position or training relates
to disciplinary limitations for decision making. Our participants
represented themselves as an engineer (SP09, SP11), CEO/Founder
(SP09,SP12), UX designer/practitioner (SP03, SP14), and product
manager (SP11). As engineers, practitioners mentioned following
procedures, training, engaging in compliance efforts on a company
level and working through a review process as a part of software
development (SP11); their primary “ethical dilemma there was that
the algorithm is as good as the data” (SP09). As a UX practitioner,
the focus was on “core priorities to create design, create research,
support other projects” (SP03), while other disciplinary perspectives for this role positioned the UX practitioner as a direct advocate
for the users. As a product manager, “you are not just expected to
work on the product features, you also need to be aware of all the
compliance and any international policies that the company is part of.
[. . . ] So as a product manager, I can go back and ask, like, how are we
displaying this data? How much information do we need to display?
Are we guiding the user that the information that they’re about to
add to the application? Are we taking consent? And all of that stuff.
So it’s just part of my role” (SP11). As a CEO/Founder, practitioners
focused on being accessible to their employees, empowering them
to make their own decisions and providing a platform or venue
to show that their opinions matter. Across all of the disciplinary
representations of their own profession, practitioners mentioned
that these limitations were often felt most acutely when joining a
company as a new employee; fears and concerns included “learning
my job” (SP09), having a fear of bringing things up, or feelings that
they“might not tell their manager this something we heard” (SP08),
all potentially reducing their scope of ethical engagement.
As the practitioners shared their disciplinary commitments and
boundaries regarding their profession, they expressed how this has
impacted their ethical engagement. For example, software developers talked about ethics as embedded and functioning in their
generated algorithms, product managers reified ethics in terms of
policies, UX practitioners exercised ethics by relating to known
user values, and CEOs positioned ethics as embeddedd in business
values and employee encouragement. Through all of these stories,
practitioners shared their moments of empowerment—what the discipline allows them to do—and disempowerment—what issues are
accessible for them to raise. As an engineer, SP08 expressed the need
of ethical training to learn the language to raise an ethical issue, and
the ability to learn that ethics is something “I would have known
that this is something I’m supposed to do.” As a UX practitioner,
SP14 expressed that he needed to be empowered to participate in
an argument as his role was not powerful enough to address ethical
discussions with the situation that was presented: “he’s got more
power and say as a product leadership person, compared to a UX
designer who’s just trying to prove a point on being reasonable,
being very decent to your users, and basically not cheating them.”
CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Chivukula, et al.
These discipline-based identities taken on by the practitioners illustrate their involvement with ethical complexities as defined by the
rhetoric of their discipline, raising the need to support and redirect
their felt responsibilities to other stakeholders with appropriate
forms of power whenever necessary.
4.5 I have a Sense of Responsibility
“I have a sense of responsibility” as an identity claim represents
practitioners that consider the current and future impact of their
work. Their awareness of sense of responsibility was illustrated
by the practitioners towards themselves, the outcomes they generated, and their organization. Practitioners expressed their sense
of responsibility towards themselves by being “selective about the
spaces [. . . and] companies” they work with, having a strong sense
of right and wrong, and feeling that choosing between the two is
“a no brainer” (SP11). Other practitioners acted constantly with the
knowledge that “every action that you perform has repercussions”
(SP12); while still others positioned this responsibility at an individual, virtue-oriented level: “everybody’s responsibility to kind of
really do it right. Even if you have all the policies in place” (SP08).
Practitioners illustrated a sense of responsibility towards the outcomes they generated by taking “ownership” of their work (SP05,
SP13) and by imagining the “feeling that you get when somebody
has that direct impact from your work” (SP05); SP14 also advocated
following ethical standards to create design outcomes as a binary:
“you either stick to compliance or you say that you are not compliant.
Don’t try to find a middle ground and don’t try to fool people—don’t
try to cheat people.” SP11 sought to acquire required knowledge in
cases where they felt that company policies may not be sufficient to
guide their decision making, while SP09 believed that they should
work to “solve the problem more holistically instead of trying to do a
vacuum all approach.” Practitioners showed their sense of responsibility towards their organization by being in leadership roles, by
providing space for their employees to “understand what you want
to have a voice about and what you don’t” (SP09) and by taking it
as their responsibility to build a secure culture for their employees
(SP12).
Having a sense of responsibility drove practitioners to be advocates, “tr[ying] to push the conversation” (SP14) within their teams
and taking things to their senior leadership: “I went up to my VP
and I said, stop; if you released this, these are the threats” (SP13).
They also took it upon themselves to drive change as mentioned by
SP11, who stated they are: “going out of my way and applying for
that grant and getting that tool and investing time and energy.” SP07
stated a similar sense of ownership: “I’m also going to work just as
hard to make something that’s going to replace it, and you’re going to
want to replace it.” While these practitioners were often advocates,
they realized their limitations—“beyond a certain point your roles
start to define how much power you have.” (SP14). In instances where
they were unable to change outcomes, these practitioners often
chose to leave those environments “where [they felt] that it’s not
ethically right for me to participate, I will definitely back off and I
would definitely kind of respectfully talk to my team members, or
my supervisor, if you want to say, or my mentor, that this is how I
feel, and they would respectfully let me go.” (SP02). This sense of
responsibility in professional practice appeared to be influenced
by the practitioners’ personal values, as mentioned by SP02: “I’m
pretty headstrong when it comes to making a decision, whether it’s a
right decision or a wrong decision. I don’t know, maybe it’s because of
the culture that I come from, or the family setting, or my history, the
way I’ve dealt with different situations in my life, personally, professionally, workwise, and all of that” and often also had the opposite
affect when practitioners attempted to take actions in their personal
life to compensate for their work as in the case of SP06: “I kind of
just started looking for ways to reduce my carbon footprint anywhere
I could [. . . ] but I think I definitely did them because I was feeling like
squeamish about being in the oil and gas industry.”
4.6 I am an Activist/Advocate
“I am an activist/advocate” as an identity claim represents practitioners who question the current state of affairs and seek to change that
state of affairs. They represent their actions of activism or advocacy
by striving for participation, shaping the culture on an ecological
level and desire to be a change maker. Practitioners strove for participation of various stakeholders in decision making as a means
of following up on and activating their concerns in relation to an
identified ethical issue. For example, SP09 conducted an exercise in
her company where the employees were given “the luxury of having
built [. . . company values] together” and SP14 and SP07 addressed
an ethical issue they identified with the design outcomes being
generated with their higher officials (such as the CIO) and other
team members, either in person or by adding them in communication channels and conversations to bring it to everyone’s notice
as an attempt to build support for self in taking the right action.
Practitioners also expressed ways of shaping their company culture by providing open spaces for communication or expression of
company values or other social issues of interest (SP09), identifying
the impact of these issues on the company and proposing ways
to find “allies to support your work,” while also identifying places
to comment, such as: “NO! We should start this at a roadmap level”
(SP04). Practitioners sought to not only to change the external state
of affairs, but created their own space and personal commitment to
push oneself to advocate for their own decisions with stakeholders.
As mentioned by SP02: “I create my own trail” and “you got to push
yourself, to basically fight those fights or be very strong in making
the decisions and kind of like create your own personal identity along
the process because it really helps you in your professional career. So
your history, your family, your community plays a very important
part.”
Practitioners expressed the motivations behind showing such activist characteristics which were either possible because they were
in a leadership position in their company, aiding them in reflecting
and taking action, building on their previous experiences that had
taught them to allow others to have freedom and become emancipated. Others had a sense of responsibility towards the products
being built, which did not always meet the ethical standards or
policies; or they sought out advocacy as a means of aligning their
sense of self with their personal and community values. Across the
examples of practitioners working to be activists, they often fell
along a continuum of creating a change in their company culture vs.
lacking the support to fully represent themselves. In our participant
stories, we observed that their efforts to create a change often had
Identity Claims that Underlie Ethical Awareness and Action CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan
more obstacles than support, leading them towards conditions that
caused them to quit their job (SP02, SP06, SP07, SP12 and SP14).
This range of examples illustrates the capabilities of an activist or
moments of support needed for a practitioner’s emancipation to
fully engage in ethically-focused decision making.
4.7 I am a Policy Follower
“I am a policy follower” as an identity claim describes practitioners
who seek to follow relevant policies that resonate with organizational, legal, or disciplinary structures that define or constrain their
ability to act. Policy followers are encouraged to follow external
policies resonating with legal structures such as GDPR, where “you
cannot keep somebody’s data more than X, Y, Z depending on what
your regulation says” (SP04). Policy followers are also expected to
align with organizational visions and goals through policies, as
illustrated the case of SP03 where she followed the diversity and
inclusion policies at her company as a part of her design decision
making process: “there is such a huge push to be inclusive and to make
sure that products can support anyone from any background.” Others
were assumed to follow policies as a part of their commitment to
their profession as shared by SP05 in the context of software development, noting: “[there is a] certain developmental process that you
have to follow and certain documentation that you have to provide”
to gain FDA Approval.
Policy followers shared their intentions to follow policies in
order to not disrupt the system that was presumed to already be
defined and structured as a series of ethical checkpoints (SP08); as
a way of evaluating their decision making based on these policies
or checklists (SP03); a means by which they could follow company
level regulations, as driven by their profession (SP05, SP14); and
as defined by business guidelines that have corresponding legal
checkpoints (SP03, SP04). Practitioners discussed their experience
of being a policy follower as a constraint in situations when they
were not being able to speak up in spaces where there was a lack
of ethical checks in place during a project, as shared by SP03: “a
lot of that is outside of our reach anyway.” SP05 mentions a similar
story, noting: “you don’t have as much influence in terms of project
direction and company direction,” with SP06 resigning to a lack of
ethical power within the policies provided: “we don’t want to be
working for big oil. But you know, this is where our paychecks come
from. And this is what we do.”
4.8 I am Deliberative/Thoughtful
“I am deliberative/thoughtful” as an identity claim embodies practitioners who internally question external sources of knowledge and
structures to trust in order to better inform their ethical decision
making. This identity claim manifests itself in two ways that illustrates practitioners’ capacity to be deliberative, and the cognitive
routes that allow for deliberation depending on the situations and
opportunities that arise for the practitioner. First, their deliberative
capacity was illustrated through their tendency to delay action,
such as by letting their coworkers make their own mistakes and
waiting before calling it in (SP12), not engaging in conflicts during
decision making (SP03, SP09), or informing employees that they
would address a certain issue later in time, since “I want everybody
to be in a better state mentally to be able to have a rational conversation around us” (SP09). Second, the cognitive actions could be
deliberative and thoughtful when the situation required them to
seek out a plethora of new information, taking time to internalizing
this knowledge before making a definite decision. For example,
SP03 described a situation where she was being deliberative in posing her decision to stall in a given design situation, arguing against
managers by saying “I feel like all I can do right now is just keep
those things documented in a place that we can bring back later
when we’re ready to design for that more open space.”
Practitioners are deliberative when they are motivated to act
in this manner due to concerns stemming from their awareness
of their environment. For example, SP07 elaborates: “I was being
a perfectionist about it and worrying about being accused of being
political. Because the whole ethics space is very, very gray area. And
I really wanted to protect this. It meant a lot to me. And I was like,
I’m not going to be accused of being biased or political.” In another
example from SP12, they sought to safeguard themselves “from any
finger pointing that backfired” by collecting and storing information
in case it would be needed to support their case. Some practitioners
were also influenced by their core personality traits, such as: “I’m not
a person to be very aggressive” (SP05) and “I’m an introvert by nature
[. . . ] you have to start learning how to talk to yourself internally,
and build that skill up over there and then externally as well.” Some
practitioners were also motivated by their desire to do what’s right,
and being deliberative was their way of determining that sense
of moral rightness: “For me, it’s kind of a no-brainer. If I ever find
myself in a situation where I have to choose between these two, my
choice will be choosing the right thing to do [. . . ] I’ve been selective
about the spaces that I choose and I have been selective about the
companies that I work for. So that’s why I actively go out and acquire
knowledge when I feel like I don’t have enough knowledge to make
these decisions” (SP11). Some practitioners also had to be deliberative
in their actions during conflicts due to a lack of external stability,
which forced on them the need to navigate ethics internally before
making a decision that could influence their external circumstance;
as expressed by SP09: “I do think there was a Maslow’s hierarchy
thing there where you do we start thinking about this stuff when you
were [. . . ] like I was an immigrant, I didn’t have my green card. You
know, I had a lot of other things that I was worried about.”
5 DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have described eight distinct identity claims of
technology practitioners, identifying the potential interactions between these claims and their ethical action and awareness.In this
section, we synthesize how these findings reveal salient interaction
trajectories among these identity claims to represent the performative nature of these identity claims. We conclude how these
interactions further elaborate and build upon Gray and Chivukula’s
[22] model of “ethical design complexity” and point towards the
importance of describing identity work to describe ethical aspects
of everyday practice.

Figure 1: Interaction Trajectories among various Identity Claims
much detail about the potential interactions among two or more
identity claims. While we cannot generalize the order in which
these identity claims occur or build on a per participant basis due to
the size of our interview sample, we have identified five interaction
trajectories that represent potential ways identity claims appear
to be interacting to impact ethical awareness and the ability for
practitioners to engage in ethical complexity, as shown in Figure 1
and described below:
• (a) Activism/Advocacy through Sense of Responsibility
OR Sense of Responsibility Leading to Activism: Practitioners’ sense of responsibility powers/ translates/ amplifies/
feeds/ leads them into being an activist when they are presented with an ethically problematic situation, even if what
they are advocating for is not directly linked to their responsibilities as a member of profession. For example, as a
UX designer, SP14 shared a conflict where he tried to “tried
to push the conversation” with his manager and teammates
about a vulnerability in a system compromising user’s data
privacy, even though his role in this instance was “not about
me being a UX practitioner and trying to tell you whether
users can do it or not. We’re not talking about user centered
design anymore. We’re talking about vulnerabilities in a system.” In this space, advocacy began from a broader sense of
values and morality, rather than beginning within the space
occupied by disciplinary or professional ethics.
• (b) Member of Profession Defining Activism or Deliberateness: Practitioners in managerial/executive roles are able
to be activists/advocates by virtue of their member of profession and for those that are in junior roles or newer professions that are less well defined (UX or design), their chance
to advocate is often manifest primarily through deliberative
roles. For example, SP09 and SP12 shared their stories as
founders of their organizations, explaining that they were
able to involve their employees in identifying company values and a “happy culture” for their employees in a much
direct sense. On the other hand, SP03 was placed within a
designer role, and shared why she was forced to be deliberative instead of take action: “it wasn’t necessarily my decision
that was made, but like as a designer, I still have to provide
to them what they asked for, even if it isn’t in my best recommendation.” Only rarely did practitioners mention how they
were deliberative as a part of their profession, which later
led to a tipping point where they became an activist: “ I’m
not a person who could be molded according to your wishes, I
would rather be more than according to the values that I have;”
in this case, SP02 “tend[s] to test the waters before jumping
into it. So that has been really helpful for me personally.”
• (c) Member of Profession Confining Policy Following:
Practitioners’ ethical actions or possibilities are confined and
defined by their profession, constraining what they believe
they are able to enact and are hence a means of limiting that
practitioner to being a policy follower. For example, SP05
shared a story relating to their role as a software developer,
comparing how his fellow developers reacted and abided
by policies or guidelines underscoring their responsibility:
“if I say that password needs to have so many characters or
whatever, then people will be like who are you, but then if I say
according to the ORS guideline or something like that, and it is
required.” In this environment, practitioners who had ethical
concerns outside of their professional purview did not feel
as if they had the ability to raise emergent ethical issues for
which they did not have relevant professional language or
binding guidelines. This tension represents a space where
disciplinarity has the potential to muffle or quell matters of
personal morality or values due largely to the presence of
job roles.
• (d) Learner through Sense of Responsibility Translating into Education: The practitioners’ sense of responsibility encouraged them to be active learners about ethics in
their profession, translating their learning into their design
outcomes and everyday decisions. For some practitioners,
this translation was manifest through the choice to become
an educator within their teams in order to build collective
sensibility. As an example of translating their learnings regarding ethics into the decisions being taken, SP07 took the
efforts to educate her colleagues to expand their knowledge
by saying: “hey, we may be in a little bit of a tech bubble here,
and here is how. [. . . ] Let’s start to think about these things a
little bit more.” They accomplished this work by giving presentations and beginning to break down areas where their
“tech bubble” may have negatively impacted their ethical
awareness. This interaction trajectory illustrates: All educators are learners, but not all learners are educators. All
translators are learners, but not all learners are translators.

Ethical Design Complexity model [22].
5.2 Ethical Design Complexity and Identity
Work
These interaction trajectories allow us to elaborate and investigate
the mediation potential of the ethical design complexity model (Figure 2a) defined by Gray and Chivukula [22], revealing opportunities
for mediation among individual beliefs, organizational practices,
and contextual ethical action with the beliefs and identity claims
of the practitioner foregrounded. This mediation illustrates some
of the tensions among the identity claims we have previously discussed, revealing trajectories through which individual and organizational practices might be changed or shaped by identity claims,
and how the knowledge that is relied upon can limit or extend
ethically-focused practices. We will draw connections between this
existing model and the interaction trajectories defined above (Figure 2b), with the goal of elaborating ethical mediation using the
language of identity, pointing towards future research that may
better describe and model the notions of identity claims and identity
work we have identified in this paper.
(1) A<->C: The interaction trajectory (a) in Figures 1 and 2b
defines an individual’s sense of responsibility, and strengthens it—allowing them to translate this responsibility into
tangible acts of advocating for ethical action, which in turn
has the potential to inscribe that responsibility into designed
outcomes. This trajectory allows the practitioner to move
beyond merely being a member of their profession, encouraging them to build on embedded moral values they might
bring into their work.
(2) B<->C: The interaction trajectory (b) in Figures 1 and 2b
presents how being a member of profession—which is a
gateway identity in a professional setting and often bound by
organizational practices—shapes the practitioner’s identity
claims of being an activist or deliberative in focusing their
applied ethics approach. Practitioners expressed how being
a part of their profession defines them being deliberative
and questioning: “How do we get the power to stay against
[the need to advocate for users over business] and don’t lose
our jobs, and never get blacklisted and be ethical to ourselves
and be ethical to the people whom we serve. We shouldn’t be
seeing it as delivery, ‘it’s a service’ and we’re getting paid”
(SP14). In contrast, due to the lack of external support or
under-specified definitions of disciplinary notions of ethics,
certain members of professions are represented as policy
followers (as in interaction trajectory (c)), which serves as a
barrier to further activism or shift in applied ethics.
(3) A<->B: The interaction trajectory (d) in Figures 1 and 2b
illustrates how practitioners are learners of ethical knowledge, which then encourages them to focus on their sense
of responsibility, often translating that knowledge to extend
organizational practices by educating others. However, in
contrast to this trajectory, our participants expressed that
being a member of profession expects them to be an educator despite the lack of external support or training, or the
limited sphere of ethics knowledge to draw on in specific
disciplinary settings or roles.
In conclusion, this overlay of identity claims, interaction patterns,
and opportunities to further describe the mediating potential of
ethics in practice provides evidence that the distinct identity claims
performed in the context of professional settings are influenced
by various tensions present in ethical design complexity. While
we do not attempt to cluster these identities solely as individual,
organizational or applied aspects of ethical action and awareness,
this analysis points towards opportunities for deeper investigation
through identity work. Identity work explores the construction,
performance, and sustainment of identity claims, serving as the
interface between the identity claims outlined in this paper and
prior work that has described the ecological conditions necessary
for ethically-focused engagement and notions of ethical design complexity. Future work could productively address the intersections
(both real and possible) between these two spaces in more depth,
identifying opportunities to empower practitioners that already
have a felt sense of responsibility and a desire to advocate for others,
and also revealing spaces where professional role or an overt focus
on only following policies might limit the uptake of ethical issues,
even if they do arise organically.
CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Chivukula, et al.
6 IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Our findings point towards the importance of practitioners’ core
beliefs, identity claims, and philosophies of ethics that create the
potential for ethical action and awareness. In the discussion section,
we have highlighted the performative nature of identities, illustrating potential future research opportunities to study identity
work, including factors that may influence identity construction
or re-construction. Future work could productively foreground the
means of supporting various aspects of ethically-aware identities,
identifying barriers to claiming or acting upon an identity to be
ethically engaged, and opportunities or motivations to further explore, reconstitute, or shape one’s identity to align professional and
personal values that lead to social change. Additionally, while our
analysis does not focus on the outcomes or performative manifestations of practitioners’ identity claims, future work could elaborate
the interaction trajectories and their overlap with the ethical design
complexity model from a disciplinary lens.
Because professional work is situated, contingent, and subjective, and ethics-related knowledge is enabled or constrained as a
part of the overall felt ethical design complexity of engaging in this
work, we also propose the need for more practice-led research approaches that investigate ethically-centered (or de-centered) work,
further detailing the role of individual, disciplinary, ecological, and
societal dimensions in technology work. This complex depiction of
technology practice also leads us to propose work that relates the
building and sustainment of competence—both from a disciplinary
perspective, and from an ethics and social responsibility perspective.
These identity claims and interaction trajectories provide insight
and direction into potential skills that may need to be commenced
during the formal education process, preparing students for the
likely possibility of disjuncture among their disciplinary values,
personal values, and the values of the organizations that they may
work for [51]. In this way, viewing the development of the “ethical
self” alongside and throughout traditional disciplinary content may
enable students to build identities that are infused with ethical reasoning, rather than viewing ethical reasoning as separate or distinct
from disciplinary knowledge or broader ways of acting and being
in the world.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a critically-focused thematic analysis of
interviews conducted with twelve technology practitioners, with
the goal of investigating, analyzing, and describing the identity
claims of these practitioners in relation to their ethical awareness
and action. We identified eight distinct identity claims that describe
their motivations and beliefs focused on their behaviors of learning,
educating, following policies, translating, being a member of profession, being deliberative, being an activist, and having a sense of
responsibility. We highlight how these claims provide a gateway to
verbalize and potentially improve practitioners’ ethical awareness
and ways of being ethically engaged in their everyday practice. We
identify several patterns of interactions among these identity claims
that frequently occurred in our data to highlight the performative
nature of these identity claims. Building on these findings, we propose future research in exploring identity work in socio-technical
practice, further describing the role of supports, behaviors, and
barriers in mediating ethical competence.
